        "do": "Do\n\nPick up a copy of Exberliner, the English-language paper targeting expats and guests of Berlin to find out what's on, when and where. It provides good quality journalism and up-to-date listings. If you understand German, the activity planners for the city, zitty and tip, are available at every kiosk. LGBT+/Queer themed magazine and guide Siegessäule is also one of the most prominent of its kind internationally. Be prepared to choose among a huge number of options.\n\nExplore\nthumb|Public bus line 100 with double decker bus\nthumb|right|\"Molecule Men\" statue at Berlin Osthafen\n\nGo on a tour of Berlin. The Mitte and surrounding districts are sufficiently compact to allow a number of excellent walking tours through its history-filled streets. You'll see amazing things you would otherwise miss. Details are usually available from the reception desks of hostels and hotels.\n\n \n Original Berlin Walks. English speaking public tour operator since 1993. They offer daily half-day walking tours of the center as well as tours focusing on WW2, the Berlin Wall, Potsdam and others. €20 per adult. \n \n \nBerlin Bootsverleih. Offers the largest variety of rental boats that you can drive yourself. Houseboats and large party boats can also be rented here.\n \n \n Private Tours of Berlin. Offers private, customized tours through Berlin, led by local historians. \n \n\nOutdoor recreation\nBerlin has many great parks which are very popular in the summer. Green Berlin operates some of them.\n\nBerlin's largest park is Großer Tiergarten (in Berlin/Mitte). In the summer and on weekends you will see loads of families with their barbecues.\n\nThere are a few notable parks in Berlin/East Central.  Superb panoramic views across south Berlin can be had in Viktoriapark in Kreuzberg. You'll also find a national monument by Schinkel on top of it.  Mauerpark is famous for the Bearpit Karaoke taking place every second Sunday in summer, and for the large flea market. It's also a popular barbecuing spot.  Görlitzer Park has barbecue area, a football ground and a minigolf company.\n\nAdjacent to Charlottenburg Palace in Berlin/City West is Schlossgarten Charlottenburg. The green areas of the park are free, so you can go there to have a walk even if you are not interested in the palace.\n\nA bit further afield with subway access in Berlin/East are the Gärten der Welt (World's Garden). Inside you can find a large, well-established Chinese garden, a Korean garden, a small Bali's Garden/Glasshouse, an Oriental Garden with nice fountains and a cloister and a Japanese garden which is a project by the city partnership of Berlin and Tokyo. Best time for a visit is in spring or summer.  A bit further afield in the opposite direction, in Berlin/Steglitz-Zehlendorf, is the Botanischer Garten und Botanisches Museum Berlin-Dahlem (Botanical Garden and Botanical Museum Berlin-Dahlem).\n\nThe large Treptower Park in Berlin/Treptow-Köpenick next to the Spree is nice and clean. It's famous for the Insel der Jugend (Isle of Youth) and its numerous boat rentals and boat trips.\n\nBerlin also has quite a few lakes and beaches suitable for swimming. They quite often have one paid area with facilities, and frequent unmanaged places with free access. Some have designated areas for nude bathing (FKK).  Wannsee in Berlin/Steglitz-Zehlendorf is called Berlin's \"bath tub\". The Strandbad Wannsee is the most famous bathing area for locals. Take the S-Bahn lines S1 or S7 to the station Nikolassee and follow the crowd! In the southeast of Berlin in Berlin/Treptow-Köpenick, you'll find the Müggelsee which is a popular swimming spot.\n\nFestivals and annual events\nthumb|French Dome at the festival of lights\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nParades\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nCultural venues\nthumb|Konzerthaus Berlin on the Gendarmenmarkt\nBerlin is arguably the live cultural centre of Germany. As it had the cultural infrastructure of two major capitals during partition, there are theatres, operas and universities galore. These are a drag on the empty municipal coffers and lead to complaints by people from other parts of Germany about subsidies, but they help keep one of the most vibrant cultural scenes in Europe alive.\n\nA comprehensive platform that lists cultural events is offered by Berlin Bühnen on behalf of about 80 venues. Berlin's notable cultural institutions for performed arts, both classical and modern, can mostly be found in Mitte and City West. Even if you aren't going to see a play or concert, many of the venues are architecturally impressive and as such attractions in themselves.\n\nOn the theatre side, the \"grand old\" title might go to Deutsches Theater, a classical theatre with an impressive line up of actors and directors. Overall, however, famous theatres in Berlin tend to have a more modern character. The reputation of Berlin theaters that they go further in challenging the norms of the art form and are bolder in experimentation than those in smaller cities dates back at least to the 1920s when names like Bert Brecht created an entirely new theater-going experience. While this approach was cut tragically short by the Nazis, it is now vibrant again as it was a century ago. Theaters with a modern approach include the Berliner Ensemble, the Maxim Gorki Theater, the sometimes controversial Volksbühne am Rosa Luxemburg Platz, the Schaubühne am Lehniner Platz as well as the Theater am Kurfürstendamm with TV celebrities in modern plays.\nThe city also has an English theatre in East Central Berlin, if you prefer performances in English. Some theatre venues are known for their musicals: the historical Theater des Westens, the Theater am Potsdamer Platz, and the Friedrichstadt-Palast, which focuses on revue type shows and offers Berlin's biggest show with over 100 artists on the biggest theatre stage in the world.\n\nFans of opera have several places to choose from. The main classical opera houses are Deutsche Oper, and Staatsoper Unter den Linden whose impressive building and royal history make the building alone worth a visit. For more modern operas, head to Komische Oper Berlin, Schiller Theater or Neuköllner Oper, voted several times best off-opera house and known for its modern and contemporary pieces. Mostly in German as usually relating to developments in Germany, and very creative and innovative.\n\nBerliner Philharmoniker is a large concert hall designed by Hans Scharoun and home of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. Famous building and outstanding musicians. Reservations are recommended, but cheaper tickets are usually available 2–4 hr before the concert if not sold out. Every Tuesday (September to June) 13:00-14:00 free lunch concert; come early. In the winter, late-night concerts (22:30 or 23:00) are a bargain and often have more avant-garde or unconventional formats. The adjacent Kammermusiksaal (Chamber Music Hall) was added later and hosts smaller concerts. Other places to enjoy classical music include Konzerthaus Berlin and Hochschule für Musik Hanns Eisler (HfM). The HfM (Berlin Academy of Music) offers many concerts by their students and other professional musicians, most of them are free.\n\nCinema\n\nThere are about a hundred cinemas in Berlin, although most of them only show movies dubbed in German, without subtitles. Listed below are some of the more important cinemas also showing movies in the original language (look for the OmU - \"original with subtitles\" - notation). Most movies which are dubbed into German are released a bit later in Germany. Tickets are normally €5-7. Monday to Wednesday are special cinema days with reduced admission.\n\nThere are three notable cinemas in Kreuzberg in Berlin/East Central within close proximity. Babylon Kreuzberg, a small cinema built in the 1950s, which shows non-mainstream movies. Kino Moviemento which is the oldest cinema in Germany (1907). In Berlin/Mitte near Hackesche Höfe there is Kino Central, a repertory cinema located in an ex-squat, and Filmtheater Hackesche Höfe showing a very broad range of movies.  Kant Kino in Berlin/City West is one of the few old cinemas (founded 1912) left in Berlin's western city. It shows mostly non-mainstream European movies.\n\nSport\n\nIn Berlin, nearly all sports are on offer; some speculate that the lukewarm support Hertha enjoys even in times of success is due to the huge offer of other sports (similar to how Los Angeles failed to maintain an NFL team due to the diverse cultural offerings):\n\n Football: Berlin has two professional soccer teams.\n Hertha BSC is the best known: they play at Olympia stadium in Charlottenburg west of the centre. The stadium itself is worth seeing - it hosted the 2006 Fifa world cup final and the infamous 1936 Olympics. The gargantuan stadium with the racetrack between the field and the stands is rarely ever filled to capacity which may explain Hertha's reputation for having lukewarm fan support.\n Union Berlin: their home stadium is in Köpenick southeast of the centre. They were the team of malcontents and opposition figures during the GDR days (while Stasi boss Erich Mielke ensured \"his\" Dynamo Berlin won most of the time) and remain the team most favored in East Berlin even during times when Hertha plays better soccer. The fierce loyalty of Union fans has led to the nickname \"eisern Union\" (\"iron union\")\n There are several semi-pro or amateur teams at lower levels: the Berlin FA lists them all.\n Berlin Handball has had a hard time competing with the north German powerhouses but these days the Füchse Berlin from Reinickendorf who play their home games in Max Schmeling Halle are a force to be reckoned with.\n \n \n Sailing, on one of the many lakes is also popular. You can find sailing clubs and most universities have ships as well.\n Golf. You can find golf clubs all around Berlin, although for non-members Motzen has one of the best.\n \n Floorball, is booming faster than ever before in the German capital. A sum of teams defines the cascade of the local floorball scene, whereas the decorated Bundesliga site of BAT Berlin probably embodies the most prominent one.\n American Football. The  Berlin Adler (Eagles) have historically been Berlin's No. 1 team but are now playing in the German Football League 2 after being relegated in 2017. They are one of the oldest and most storied teams in Germany being a founding member of the first American Football season in 1979. Having fallen to the second division means they don't get to play either their crosstown rivals or their fiercest other rival, the Dresden Monarchs. The Berlin Rebels  have since taken the mantle of \"best GFL team in Berlin\" and usually land in the middle of the pack of the GFL1 north but haven't penetrated deep into the playoffs thus far. Finally there is Berlin Thunder, a new addition created in 2021 for the new \"European League of Football\" who are named after the old NFL Europe team of bygone days. Whether they can sustain fan enthusiasm with their lackluster on-field performance remains to be seen. American Football in Germany is a very relaxed and family friendly affair and you can definitely show up in any NFL, German or no Football gear at all and have a chat with fans of either side.\n "

        "do": "Do\nSports\n \n Football:  play soccer in Ligue 1, the top tier, and often win it. But don't head for the central district of Saint-Germain-des-Prés! PSG play at Parc des Princes Stadium in the 16th arrondissement south of Bois de Boulogne. The club name derives from Saint-Germain-en-Laye 20 km west. \n Paris FC are the poor relations, playing in Ligue 2, at Stade Charléty on the peripherique in the 13th arrondissement.\n \n Rugby: two clubs play rugby union (15 a side) in Top 14, the French top tier. Racing play at La Défense Arena (or U Arena) in Nanterre. Stade Français play big games at Stade de France and others at Stade Jean-Bouin, next to Parc de Princes the PSG soccer stadium.\n\nEvents\nIt seems like there's almost always something happening in Paris, with the possible exceptions of the school holidays in August and February, when about half of Parisians are to be found not in Paris, but in the South of France or the Alps respectively. The busiest season is probably the fall, from a week or so after la rentrée scolaire or \"back to school\" to around Noël (Christmas) theatres, cinemas and concert halls book their fullest schedule of the year.\n\nGood listings of current cultural events in Paris can be found in Pariscope or Officiel des spectacles, weekly magazines listing all concerts, art exhibitions, films, stage plays and museums. Available from all kiosks. Timeout is a good option for tourists, who don't speak French.\n\nEven so, there are a couple of annual events in the winter, starting with a furniture and interior decorating trade fair called Maison & Object in January.\n\nIn February le nouvel an chinois (Chinese New Year) is celebrated in Paris as it is in every city with a significant Chinese and Vietnamese population. There are parades in the 3rd and 4th arrondissements and especially in the Quartier Asiatique (Asian Quarter) in the 13th south of Place d'Italie. Also in February is the Six Nations Rugby Tournament which brings together France, England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Italy.\n\nThe International Agricultural Show (Salon Internationale de l'Agriculture) usually takes place over a week around the end of February/beginning of March at the Porte de Versailles exhibition centre. It is unmissable (not just for tourists but also French politicians wanting to appear in touch with rural France), and showcases large numbers of domestic animals as well as selling speciality food products from all over France and its former colonies in Africa. Particularly recommended are the food stalls from the overseas territories where you can try regional specialities that are hard to come by even in Metropolitan France, and they will often also have performances from folk musicians/dancers. It's usually advised to buy tickets in advance as the queues for entry can be long.\n\nThe first of two Fashion weeks occurs in March: Spring Fashion Week, giving designers a platform to present women's prêt-à-porter (ready to wear) collections for the following winter.\n\nIn June, Rendez-vous au Jardin is an open house for many Parisian gardens, giving you a chance to meet real Parisian gardeners and see their creations. The Fête de la Musique celebrates the summer solstice (21 June) with this city-wide free musical knees-up. Finally on the 26th of June is the Gay Pride parade, featuring probably the most sincere participation by the mayor's office of any such parade on the globe.\n\nThe French national holiday Bastille Day on the 14th of July celebrates the storming of the infamous Bastille during the French Revolution. Paris hosts several spectacular events that day of which the best known is the Bastille Parade which is held on the Champs-Élysées at 10:00 and broadcast to pretty much the rest of Europe by television. The entire street will be crowded with spectators so arrive early. The Bastille Day Fireworks is an exceptional treat for travellers lucky enough to be in town on Bastille Day. The Office du Tourisme et des Congress de Paris recommends gathering in or around the champ de Mars, the gardens of the Eiffel Tower.\n\nAlso in July, Cinema en Plein Air is the annual outdoor cinema event that takes place at the Parc de la Villette, in the 19th on Europe's largest inflatable screen. For most of the months of July and August, parts of both banks of the Seine are converted from expressway into an artificial beach for Paris Plages. Also in July the cycling race le Tour de France has a route that varies annually, however it always finishes on the last Sunday of July under the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nOn the last full weekend in August, a world-class music festival Rock en Seine draws international rock and pop stars to the Domaine national de Saint-Cloud, just west of Paris.\n\nDuring mid-September DJs and (usually young) fans from across Europe converge on Paris for five or six days of dancing etc. culminating in the Techno parade - a parade whose route traces roughly from Place de la Bastille to the Sorbonne, and around the same time the festival Jazz à la Villette brings some of the biggest names in contemporary jazz from around the world.\n\nIn the beginning of autumn the vine harvest fest takes place. The most famous is the Fête des Vendanges de Montmartre, a food festival around the vine harvest of the Montmartre vineyard.\n\nThe Nuit Blanche transforms most of central Paris into a moonlit theme-park for an artsy all-nighter on the first Saturday of October, and Fashion Week returns shortly thereafter showing off Women's Prêt-à-Porter collections for the following summer; as we've noted winter collections are presented in March.\n\nThe third Thursday in November marks the release of Le Beaujolais Nouveau and the beginning of the Christmas season. This evening, the Christmas lights are lit in a ceremony on the Champs-Élysées, often in the presence of hundreds (if not thousands) of people and many dignitaries, including the president of France.\n\nUnfortunately, there are no comprehensive event guides covering concerts, clubs, movies or special events. For theatre, movies and exhibitions pick up the Pariscope and L'officiel du Spectacle, available at newsstands for €0.40. For (especially smaller, alternative) concerts pick up LYLO, a small, free booklet available in some bars and at FNAC. There is no user-friendly online version of these guides.\n\nPhotography\n\nParis is considered by many as the birthplace of photography, and while one may debate the correctness of this claim, there is no debate that Paris is today a photographer's dream. The French capital offers a spectacular array of photographic expositions and opportunities to the beginner and the pro alike. It has photogenic monuments (e.g., Arc de Triomphe, Eiffel Tower, the obelisk at Concorde, and countless others); architecture (e.g., the Louvre, Notre Dame, the Museum of the Arab World) and urban street scenes (e.g., in the Marais, Montmartre and Belleville). When you tire of taking your own photos, visit one of the many institutions dedicated to photography. At these and other institutions, you can learn the about the rich history of Paris as the place of important developments in photography (e.g., the Daguerrotype) and as the home of many of the trade's great artists (e.g., Robert Doisneau, André Kertész, Eugene Atget and Henri Cartier-Bresson).\n\n \nJeu de Paume, at the entrance of Tulerie Gardens, is one of the city's premier photography exhibition sites.\n\nParis Photo, one of the world's most important art fairs, takes place in the autumn.\n\nMovies\n\nThe Cinémas of Paris are (or at least should be) the envy of the movie-going world. Of course, like anywhere else you can see big budget first-run films from France and elsewhere. That though, is just the start. During any given week there are at least half-a-dozen film festivals going on, at which you can see the entire works of a given actor or director. Meanwhile, there are some older cult films like say, What's new Pussycat or Casino Royal which you can enjoy pretty much any day you wish.\n\nMany non-French movies are subtitled (called \"version originale\" \"VO\" or \"VOstfr\" as opposed to \"VF\" for version française).\n\nThere are any number of ways to find out what's playing, but the most commonly used guide is Pariscope, which you can find at newsstands for €0.70. Meanwhile, there are innumerable online guides which have information on \"every\" cinema in Paris.\n\nThe Cinemathèque française and the Forum des Images are the two public film institutions that organize retrospectives, exhibitions and festivals.\n\nTheatres\nThe , as well as its associated ballet company, the Paris Opera Ballet, are considered to be among the premier classical performance companies in the world.\n\nIf you are under 26, there is a flat rate of €10 for every private theatre of the town every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday night. This fare does not apply to public theatres nor opera.\n\nWith children\nthumb|Luxembourg Gardens and Palais du Luxembourg (Sénat) in AprilParis Mômes is a Parisian cultural guide with children's activities and events that comes out several times a year.\n\n Cité des enfants in the 19th, a museum for kids within the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie, is interactive, fun, and educational. There are two separate sections for the 3-5 set and the 5-12 set. The tots section has simple exhibits designed to be pushed, prodded, and poked. The section for older kids is more sophisticated with scientific experiments and TV studios. Métro Porte de la Villete (7)\n Jardin du Luxembourg in the 6th. It would be counted as a travesty not to take your under 10 year old to the Jardin du Luxembourg, long a favourite with Parisian children. With its world famous merry-go-round, a pond for sail boats, a puppet theater, pony rides, chess players, children's playground, it has something for every kid (with comfortable chairs for weary parents thrown in!). The marionettes du Luxembourg, the puppet theatre, stages classic French puppet shows in French but should be easy to understand. There are numerous places for a snack. RER Luxembourg (B) or Métro Odéon (4, 10)\nParc des Buttes-Chaumont in the 19th. Buttes-Chaumont is great for those with children that like to run, climb, and explore. Built on the site of an abandoned quarry, the park is roughly bowl-shaped with a 30-meter-tall peak situated in the middle of a pond at the park's center. There are trails up the rock, caves, waterfalls, a suspension bridge, and a small stone gazebo on the top of the rock with a 360-degree view. There is also a puppet theater and a playground. Métro Buttes-Chaumont (7bis), Botzaris (7bis), or Laumière (5)\n Parc Zoologique in the 12th. This zoo is different because of a 236-foot artificial mountain bang in its center. Take elevators to the top and enjoy the view or watch the mountain goats do their stuff on the sides. Lions, tigers, and everything designed to delight kids can be found in the zoo if the mountain doesn't do it for your kids. RER/Métro Gare d'Austerlitz (5, 10, C)\n The Jardin d'Acclimatation in the 16th has a number of rides, including pint-sized roller coasters suitable for children as young as three years, as well as a mini-zoo and the estimable Musée en Herbe. Métro Les Sablons (1)\nThe Parc Floral, in the Bois de Vincennes, has different themed playgrounds, ping pong tables and picnic areas. During winter the entrance is free."

    "London": {
        "do": "Do\nLondon is a huge city, so all individual listings are in the appropriate district articles. To make the most of the city's tremendous cultural offerings (performing arts, museums, exhibitions, clubs, eateries and numerous others), visitors will do well to pick up a copy of a cultural magazine like Time Out London (available at most corner shops and newsagents) which gives detailed information and critiques on what's around town including show times and current attractions. The Time Out London website also has major shows listed. There is also apps available, although the print version tends to be more detailed.\n\nLive music\nLondon is one of the best cities in the world for concerts, spanning from new musical trends to well-known bands. Between huge concert facilities and small pubs, there are hundreds of venues that organise and promote live music every week. Many concerts, especially in smaller or less known places are free, so there is plenty of choice even for tourists on a budget.\n\nLondon has long been a launchpad for alternative movements, from the mods of the 1960s, punks of the 70s, new romantics of the 80s, the Britpop scene of the 90s, and the indie rock and rock movements in the 21st century. It has one of the world's most lively live music scenes: any band heading a British, European or World tour will play London, not to mention the local talent. London's music scene is incredibly diverse, covering all genres of music from electro-jazz to death-metal, and all sizes of bands, from the U2s and Rolling Stones of the world to bands that disband after their first gig. This diversity is reflected in prices. As a rough guide: £40 and up for 'top 40' bands in arena-sized venues, £20 and up for established bands in mid-sized venues, £10 or more for up-and-coming bands and club nights in smaller venues, £5 and up for new bands in bars and pubs (as of 2024).\n\nLondon has hundreds of venues spread out over the city and the best way to know what's going on where is to browse online ticket agencies, Music Magazines gig directories and bands' social media pages. A few areas which have higher concentrations of pubs and venues than others. Kilburn in North West London has long been known as an Irish area; though their numbers have somewhat declined, a visit to a local pub will show their influence remains today.\n\n Theatre \n\nThe West End, especially the areas concentrated around Leicester Square, Covent Garden, Shaftesbury Avenue and Haymarket, is one of the world's premier destinations for theatre, including musical theatre. Covent Garden has the only actor-sponsored school in the city, the Actors Centre. In the centre of Leicester Square there is an official half-price TKTS booth. Be wary of other ticket offices -including those claiming to be the \"Official Half-Price Ticket Office\" - as these may have higher prices, and have been known to sell fake tickets. For up-to-date listings see the weekly magazine Time Out or check the Official London Theatre site.\n\nThe South Bank is another area well known for world class theatre, and is home to the National Theatre and the Globe Theatre, the latter of which is London's only thatched building and an attraction in itself. Each Globe performance has over 700 £5 tickets. London's theatre scene outside of these two main districts is known as \"the Fringe\". Several of the larger and more established fringe theatres are an excellent way to see top quality productions of plays that may move to the West End, but at lower than West End prices. The most significant of these are:\n\n \n \n \n\nOther things to do\nthumbnail|A Guardsman on duty at Buckingham Palace\n\nTake a walk through London's Royal Parks. A good walk would start at Paddington station, and head through Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park, Green Park (passing Buckingham Palace) and St James's Park before crossing Trafalgar Square and the River Thames to the South Bank and Waterloo station. At a strolling pace this walk would take half a day, with plenty of places to stop, sit, drink, and eat en route.\n \n Watch football: London has over a dozen professional football clubs, plus Wembley Stadium, the national stadium of England, hosting internationals (including World Cup and European Championships qualifiers) and the finals of club competitions, notably the FA Cup and the League Cup. As of 2024, London has six clubs in the Premier League, the top tier of English football: Arsenal, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Brentford, Tottenham Hotspur (Spurs), Fulham, and West Ham United. In the second tier, the Championship, are Millwall and Queens Park Rangers (QPR). In the third tier, League One, are Charlton Athletic and Leyton Orient; and in the fourth tier, League Two, are AFC Wimbledon and Sutton United. Other clubs slug it out in the lower leagues, semi-professional going on amateur. International and top club matches need booking in advance, and at clubs like Arsenal and Chelsea, its nearly impossible to get tickets without some sort of club membership or through a shady third party website or a scalper, which are both best avoided as the tickets probably aren't even valid. However, at smaller clubs you can just turn up and pay at the gate. At bottom-end clubs there's actually a risk that you might be begged to strip off and take the field to make up an eleven. Hackney & Walthamstow marshes have football teams and playing fields the way Xanadu had caverns measureless to man, with a thin drizzle blowing in off a sunless sea.\n Watch rugby union, 15-a-side. Internationals are played at Twickenham west of the city - the Six Nations games are likely to sell out. Three London teams play in the Premiership, the top tier of club rugby in England: Harlequins, London Irish and Saracens. You'll see famous international players in these club fixtures.\n (Tube: Southfields)\n Watch cricket at the Oval (Lambeth) or Lord's (St Johns). Both host county and Test matches (i.e. internationals, lasting up to 5 days).\n \n Winter skating. During the winter months multiple outdoor ice rinks pop up across London. Considered by some to be somewhat overpriced and overcrowded, they nonetheless have multiplied, easing congestion and increasing competition. Most charge from £10-12 (adults) for an hour on the ice, including skate hire. See the district articles for the City of London, East End and Leicester Square.\n Summer skating. In summer (and also in winter, for the more dedicated) there is also a thriving roller skating (on inline and traditional \"quad\" skates) scene in London, catering to many disciplines including street hockey, freestyle slalom, dance, general recreational skating (including three weekly marshalled group street skates) and speed skating. This mostly centres around Hyde Park (on the Serpentine Road) and Kensington Gardens (by the Albert Memorial). See the district articles for Mayfair-Marylebone and South West London.\n\n Photography. Buildings such as museums, churches and art galleries will display their own guidelines clearly. In many public buildings the use of tripods and flash are not permitted.Hidden London. A series of tours run by the London Transport Museum exploring the hidden depths of the Underground, including abandoned stations and tunnels; plus there are visits to TfL's famous art deco headquarters (55 Broadway) and \"access all areas\" inside looks at operational stations such as Charing Cross and Euston. Demand is high for what is quite a restricted annual programme, and you can purchase a maximum of four tickets per tour. Adults: £41.50, concession: £36.50. This ticket includes a day pass to the LT Museum, to be used within a month of the event date, and gives you a 10% discount on all merchandise bought at the museum shop or online within the same period.NFL International Series'. NFL (American Football) games held in Wembley and Twickenham Stadiums. Usually held on Sunday evenings or afternoons between October and December of each year."

        "do": "Do\n\nthumb|right|250px|Fossil cliffs near Dubai\nright|thumb|250px|China Pavilion in Global Village\n\n Abra ride. A boat ride is best done at night in the cool weather and to enjoy the city lights. Abras can be hired for a private tour (for a price negotiable with the driver, but usually very cheap). This is quite a popular activity at sunset on a clear day, particularly if the driver is able to enliven the tour with stories about the structures on either side of the Creek. Just make sure that the purpose of one's abra hire is made clear at the outset, otherwise, you will be in for a very expensive cross-river trip or a crowded private tour.\n Beaches and sea. There are endless water sports opportunities as Dubai has some of the whitest and sandiest beaches in the world. Ocean temperatures range from  in winter up to  in summer, there are few wave breaks and the strong winds can make swimming difficult. The water is also very salty so many prefer to use their hotel swimming pool. Diving activities have been severely affected by offshore construction work for the Palms and The World; consequently, long boat trips are necessary to reach wreck sites. Alternatively, one can make the 90-minute road journey to the East coast Emirate of Fujairah or the Sharjah enclave, Khor Fakkan, for top-class diving on coral reefs supporting extensive marine life.\nCamel race track. One of the more unusual attractions, with races being held on Thursday and Friday in the winter. You can watch the races, and you'll have the opportunity to visit the paddocks. Vendors sell everything from beads to rugs and blankets, so you can purchase souvenirs.\nHorse racing has a long tradition in the Arab world, and Dubai's Meydan Racecourse is one of the most famous horse racing venues in the world, holding races for both Thoroughbred and purebred Arabian horses. Gambling is illegal, so there are no on-site betting facilities, but the grandstand is a marvel of modern architecture, and particularly spectacular when lit up at night.\n Desert safari or dune bashing. Head out to the desert in an SUV with specialist desert drivers. The drivers will take you for a thrilling roller-coaster ride over sand dunes, show you the sunset from a strategic vantage point and then take you to a traditional Arabic Bedouin campsite where you'll be offered lavish barbecue buffet dinner with music and belly dance to complete the atmosphere. The duration of the tour is usually around five hours. You may want to stay clear of the dune bashing if you get carsick easily. A desert safari is one of the best things to do while in Dubai. Another option would be renting/buying a 4x4 and joining the many growing 4x4 clubs in the UAE, but only if you're an extremely experienced driver and hold an international driving license. Neighboring cities including Abu Dhabi also have their own, such as AD4x4. For all of the Dubai-based clubs, membership is free of charge and they conduct trips for beginners into the desert on a regular basis.\n Natural outdoors. Although at first glance the outdoors may seem dull and uninteresting, and even dangerous due to the desert conditions, there are actually amazing natural destinations in the Emirate of Dubai, which extends into Hatta. There are pristine waterfalls, cliffs lined with fossils, and even freshwater lakes.\n Yacht charter is an easy way to explore the man-made Palm Islands and coastal skyscrapers. Fleets are available for hire from Dubai Marina from many of the yacht charter agencies.\n Dubai Creek cruise. Dubai Creek is the foundation from which Dubai grew. It was built as a port for trading vessels plying to and from India, Africa and the Middle East. Today a bit of the old shipping culture still remains. In and around the Creek one can see some of the original buildings that have served as customs houses and defence structures. You can book a ride (usually four hours) on the Dubai Marina cruise or rent a private boat to take you on an hour-long ride up and down the Creek.\n Burj Khalifa: Visit the tallest building in the world with the magnificent centrepiece of Dubai, Burj Khalifa is surrounded by hotels, must-visit shopping destinations and a world of entertainment options.\n Golf. It may be a desert, but a lot of money and water is spent on irrigating opulent golf courses. Alternatively, for a more local flavour, try sand golf.\n The Dubai International Film Festival is the city's not-for-profit cultural event. As a major festival for Arab cinema, it showcases a selection of films from the Middle East, Africa and Asia."

        "do": "Do\n\nthumb|Marine Drive\nThere is a lot to do in Mumbai, but lack of space means that for outdoorsy activities, you need to head north, often outside city limits. In North Munbai and Thane, you will find opportunities for water sports like H2O at Girgaon Chowpatty. There are two golf courses in the city, the more famous one in Chembur in the Harbour Suburbs.\n\nMumbai has a vibrant theatre scene with plays in many languages including English, Hindi, Gujarati, and Marathi. While South Mumbai has frequent performances, the best organised theatre effort is at Prithvi theatre, Juhu in the Western Suburbs. There are plenty of opportunities to enjoy Indian classical music and dance. While not a patch on the Sabhas of Chennai, you will find frequent performances of Carnatic music in Shanmukhananda Hall, Matunga in North Central Mumbai.\n\nMumbai is also usually the first stop for Western pop and rock stars visiting India, which they usually do when they are over 50. The Rock scene is very good in Mumbai. These are very safe to go to and are recommended for rock fans. Most bands cover heavy metal acts like Pantera, Six feet under, and Slipknot.

Expect whistles and clapping by crowd in admiration of their celebrities on the screen, except at multiplexes as this occurs at single-screen movie theatres. Most of the cinema halls run both 'popular and new' Bollywood as well as Hollywood movies and some even screen ones in regional languages. Some of the popular Hollywood screening cinema halls in South Mumbai are Eros opposite Churchgate, Metro on M.G.Road, Regal in Colaba, Sterling next to CST Station, and New Excelsior in Fort. With the rise of malls and multiplexes, the nearest cinema is unlikely to be more than a stone's throw away, even in the suburbs. Check out newspaper listing to get the list of latest screenings.\n Watch Cricket for Free; cricket has a national games stature in India, and Mumbaikars revere that every day of the year. Azad Maidan (Azad ground) near Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, ground opposite to Ruia College in Matunga and Shivaji Park in Dadar west are some of the best places to witness the cricket fever for free. You may be even lucky to witness ongoing game of cricket on some of the empty streets of Mumbai.\n\nFestivals\n\nWhile many religious festivals are celebrated by people in Mumbai, a few of these are essentially public and social occasions, where the traveller can participate.\n\n Organised festivals and events \n\n \n \n \n Mumbai Festival (Jan) Sample the vibrant culture of the city.

See the colourful processions and participate in them, the biggest of which is on the last day of the celebrations where the largest idol is brought to Chowpatty for immersion in the wee-small hours of the morning and can vary depending on the crowd and pace of travel from Lal Bagh to the beach. The Lalbaug, Parel, Matunga and Dadar areas represent some of the best large scale decorations. On the last day of the festival, processions are carried out to bid bye to the loved deity in the sea. These presentations are colourful and carry a celebration fever. The best places to watch them are Girgaon and Dadar Chowpatty (beach) or the main roads such as Ambedkar Road from where the processions are carried out.\n Janmashtami (Jul/Aug) Birth Anniversary of Lord Krishna. Earthen pots full of curd are strung high up across the streets. Young men stand on top of one another to form a human pyramid and attempt to break the pots.\n Mt.

    "Istanbul": {
        "do": "Do\n\n Hamam – Sultanahmet has many historical hamams. Some are very extravagant and cater mainly to tourists.\n Waterpipe – Most of the places where you can smoke a nargile are in Yeniçeriler Caddesi, near the Kapalı Çarşı (Grand Bazaar). Çorlulu Ali Paşa and Koca Sinan Paşa Türbesi are both in secluded internal courts, just around the corner from some tomb yards, while Rumeli Kahvesi is actually inside the cemetery of an old medrese, though it’s not as spooky as you might think. In the south of Sultanahmet, near the sea, is Yeni Marmara (Çayıroğlu Sokak), where you can also sit in the terrace and enjoy the view. In Beyoğlu, at the Ortakahve (Büyükparmakkapı), there’s even the choice of a wide range of flavors. Another area with few big good looking places is the Rıhtım Caddesi, between Galata bridge and Istanbul Modern Museum.\n\nWalking tours\nMuseums and such: Haghia Sophia, then on to the Topkapı museum (these two should take at least three to five hours), preferably along the road in the back of the Haghia Sophia, where there are some nicely restored houses. Then on to the Blue Mosque and the square with the obelisks on it (At Meydani). Along its side is the very good Museum of Islam Art. Descend slightly and find the small Haghia Sophia with its nice garden (it was under restoration, but you probably can get in). Then uphill to the Sokollu Mehmet mosque complex, top notch tiles inside.\n\nTake a tram or walk to Eminönü (where the boats leave for trips to Asia or up the Bosphorus). Visit the New Mosque at the back, then the Egyptian Bazaar next to it, and going further in that direction, locate the Rüstem Pasha mosque with its excellent tiles. It's on a raised platform near an old clothes market, you may have to ask directions. Then take a cab or find a bus to Eyüpsultan mosque complex, a mile or three up the Golden Horn. Visit this Eyüpsultan complex at your leisure (the mosque is not particular, the court is, and the milling of believers, with many boys-to-be-circumcised among it; a Friday might be a good day to do this). Then, if you have the stamina, it might be nice to walk back too; maybe all the way (8 km or so), but taking a route along part of the city wall to first the famous Kariye Church with its mosaics, then on to Yavuz Selim Mosque with its great view on the Golden Horn (and a fine mosque by itself), then the Fatih Mosque (passing through some very religious and lively neighborhoods), then on to the well-restored Sehzade mosque, and next to Süleymaniye (don't forget to enjoy the view from the Golden Horn side). If you have some energy left, you might go on to the University complex, and by then you are very close to the Beyazit mosque. A book market (it’s small) is behind this good, unexceptional (nice courtyard though) mosque.\n\nOnce again go to Eminönü, but this time take the boat (those large ferries) to Üsküdar. You will arrive before a fine mosque in front, another one 400 m off to the right, slightly inland behind a traffic roundabout, and a third, very small, at the sea front. See the market stretching inland, walk about and don't forget to walk along the shore, maybe eating a fish meal in one of the bobbing boats along it. This is a good visit for late afternoon, early evening, fleeing the city. You will be joined by thousands of people going home from \"town\" but the way back will be on a near-empty ferry. The frequency of ferries will go down in the evening, so make sure there is a connection back.\n\nGo to the railroad station and find a Sirkeci-Halkali suburban train, and get out at (from memory, Yedikule station). You will be quite close to Yedikule, a nice fortress, and will have fine views of the city walls. The trains leave every 15 minutes or so, the ride is peculiar (the material is bad, but if you are in luck every second stop another salesman will enter and try selling his wares, it’s fun). The ride is takes anywhere from twenty minutes to half an hour. This is not a \"must\", but it can be great fun.\n\nYou will have missed the covered bazaar in all this. That is because you will get there anyhow. If you go to Beyazit and the book market you are almost at two of its many entrances. Try and find the Nuruosmaniye Mosque and its complex at the other side, it’s worth it. And after having explored the covered part, take a relaxing walk downhill, into the general direction of Eminönü, where it is \"uncovered bazaar\" all the way. Cross the Galata bridge to see some things on the Northern side (for instance take the \"tünel\" teleferik ride up much of the hill (entrance close to the opposite side of Galata bridge, ask around)), then continue to Taksim. Shops are of the international variety.\n\nTheodosian Walls Walk\nthumb|A restored section of the city walls at the Belgradkapı gate, close to the Marmara coast\n\nFrom 408 CE the original walls of Constantine were replaced in the reign of Theodosius. These walls then became the critical point of defence of the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire and their Ottoman successors. They are still almost completely intact, marking the western border of the peninsula of Old City, with some sections suffering from somewhat unsightly restoration done in early 1990s. The section around the Topkapı Gate (not to be confused with Topkapı Palace which is located in an altogether different place) can be easily accessed from Pazartekke tram station, which lies about 300 m east of the walls. Some remoter sections may not be very safe and may require some caution.\n\nA 7-km walk along and on these remaining portions of the city wall offers a window into antiquity and puts emphasis on Turkey’s terrible historic monument legacy. Download and print a scholarly historical and technical description of the walls before you visit Istanbul; this will certainly add to the pleasure. From Eminönü, take the Golden Horn ferry to Ayvansaray. This ferry terminal is separate from the Bosphorus terminals adjacent and east of the Galata Bridge. Walk west through the Galata bridge underpass, then through the bus station to a pedestrian lane way which leads to the small terminal building. The fare is 1.50 TL. Leave the ferry at Ayvansaray and cross the park to the wall on the other side of the main road. You have a choice of walking up the outer wall or the inner wall but access to the top of the battlements is usually on the inside naturally enough, so go up the small street across the road which then cuts back behind the wall and the towers. Here you can climb up onto this section of unrestored wall on crumbling brick and stone and continue on some hundreds of yards climbing as necessary. This path comes to an obvious end and one can short cut back to the street. Sometimes there are dwellings and commercial enterprises hard up against the wall, sometimes a bus depot, a rubbish dump or often just the road. These walls replaced the earlier walls of Constantine in 408 CE after which they went through constant upgrade and repairs to earthquake damage. The different work done over the centuries was all of varying style and quality. Quite surprisingly there are a number of small streets still using the narrow gates. At Hoca Çakır Cd one comes across a restored section of the wall where the heights are accessed by stairs (junction of Hoca Çakır Caddesi and Kariye Bostani Sokak), some along the top of the wall of the steeper variety. This restoration from the 1980s is in conflict with the original. The wall is then breached for the main road Fevzi Paşa Cd. Cross this and continue along the street at the back of the wall. Look for foot pads and breaks in the wall which allows access and a good look around. The wall is breached again for Adnan Menderes Blv (unofficially and widely known as Vatan Caddesi). Past here one see here quite clearly the double line of defence with outer moat. The next breach is for Turgut Özal Cd (unofficially and widely known as Millet Caddesi) which hosts the tram line heading back to Sultanahmet for those who have run out of steam. Walking now on the outside of the walls, various breaks in the outer wall allow access via broken stonework or later via modern sets of steps in disrepair. Between the walls is the disquieting evidence of the number of people sleeping rough in Istanbul. Persevere in staying between the walls because soon you will arrive at another impure restoration project at Mevlanakapı Cd gate. Entry to the gate towers has been closed at the gate, so entry is only from the walls. From here it is better to proceed on the outside of the walls because market gardens occupy the moat and the city side abuts buildings. These couple of kilometres will give a further perspective of the ravages of time and earthquake on the walls. Finally you will arrive at the Golden Gate and Yedikule Fortress which fronts the Marmara Sea and was Byzantium’s triumphal point of entry. This is in excellent condition not least because the Ottomans upgraded it and then used it right up to the 19th century. There is an entry fee and it has a toilet. The high walls and towers are all accessible, and one tower still has internal wooden floors. So you have now surveyed the protective land walls which kept Byzantium and the Eastern Roman Empire safe for all those years after the fall of Rome, breached only by the 4th Crusaders and the Ottomans. What of their future? Given that recent restoration work is fairly suspect scholars may think it is better to leave them be. Now return to the city either in the Eminönü Bus (#80) from the village square outside the main gate, just wait there, or walk down Yedikule Istasyonu Cd about 300 m to the railway line to Sirkeci, both heading for centres close to Sultanahmet.\n\nThe classic Bosphorus cruise\nthumb|Night View of the 15 July Martyrs Bridge\nFrom the terminal at Eminou, the public ferry starts east of the Galata Bridge cruising to Anadolu Kavagi at the northern entrance of Bosphorus to the Black Sea via various stops. \n\nThe fare is 65 TL (round trip) on the public ferry, Sehir Hatlari, and tickets can only be bought at the ticket booth around one hour prior to departure. The departure time is early (10:35am) and is very popular, so arrive early and queue for a ticket (the ferry does not wait for people late to arrive to buy tickets). Touts for private ferry operators often attempt to sell alternative ferry tickets. They will attempt various tactics to make you feel uncomfortable, such as shifting the public ferry ticket office line to be in the hot sun and telling you that full cruise will waste a day of your stay in Istanbul. This is generally a scam, they will charge an extortionate rate, or a cheaper rate followed by an extortionate return fee. Note that the public ferry offers no audio commentary at all, it is very barebones and on you to spot sights of significance. The public ferry does not offer toilet paper and the washroom is generally in a deplorable state; you will need to bring your own toilet paper if needed and potentially wait in line for a great deal of time if you plan to use the washroom.\n\nThere are various other private ferry companies offering various cruises. Compared to the public ferry, they will typically charge significantly higher prices but may offer audio commentary via a loudspeaker, a washroom with toilet paper or have a shorter line. The private ferries almost exclusively offer the short Bosphorus tour starting at 70 TL.\n\nThe open decks are hugely popular on the weekends, so unless you have an outside seat expect people to be standing all around you constricting the view. The ferry waits some hours in Anadolu Kavagi so as you alight you are confronted by a numerous restaurants and their spruikers. \n\nAfter landing at Anadolu Kavagi, take the walk to the Yoros Kalesi, a strategic castle overlooking and controlling the entry to the Black Sea. The area can be dangerous and hazardous without good shoes, but the direct footpath to the castle is paved all the way, only the last 10m to the viewing points aren't. This important fortification with a commanding view has been fought over for many years and was last in use in the 19th century. It has fallen into serious disrepair, but Christian engravings are still visible in the stonework. It has a spectacular view of the mouth of the Black Sea.\n\nThere are restaurants actually in the castle surrounds, such as Yoros Cafe, and naturally have spectacular views but mediocre food and service. There is plenty of time left to wander back to the village for lunch. It is late afternoon before arrival back at Eminonu, but a day well spent.\n\n Soccer \n\nIstanbul has six clubs playing in Süper Lig, the top tier of Turkish association football: Beşiktaş, Fenerbahçe, Galatasaray, Başakşehir, Kasımpaşa and Eyüpspor. The first three have always been in the top tier and have international reputations. Matches between these sides are played in front of fiercely partisan sell-out crowds; getting tickets requires booking way in advance. As the atmosphere is extremely hostile to the away teams, spectators should avoid wearing away team colours after the match, and avoid any signs of crowd trouble.\n\nBeşiktaş JK plays at Vodafone Park, a 41,903-capacity stadium. It's on the European bank of the Bosphorus next to Dolmabahçe Palace, 1 km east of Taksim metro station.\n\nFenerbahçe SK play at the 47,834-capacity Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium (also called Ülker Stadium). It's on the Asian bank of the Bosphorus, 1 km east of Kadıköy metro station and ferry quay.\n\nGalatasaray SK plays at the 52,332-capacity Türk Telekom Stadium on the north edge of European Istanbul, take metro to Seyrantepe.\n\nBaşakşehir FK play at the 17,319-capacity Fatih Terim stadium. It's a long way out on the northwest edge of the city, 1 km north of Metrokent station on line M3.\n\nKasımpaşa SK play at the 14,234-capacity Recep Tayyip Erdoğan Stadium, in Beyoğlu district just north of the Golden Horn. It's named for the current Turkish President, who grew up nearby and played football in his youth.\n\nEyüpspor were promoted to Süper Lig for the first time in 2024. Their 2500-capacity stadium is in Eyüp district north of the O-1 Bosphorus Bridge. \n\nOther pro teams in lower tiers include Istanbulspor, Fatih Karagümrük and Pendikspor. \n\nThe Turkish national stadium is Atatürk Olympic Stadium (Atatürk Olimpiyat Stadı), a 76,000-capacity arena at the western edge of the city, use either Olimpiyat or Olimpiyat Parkı metro station. It doesn't have a resident team, but several clubs have had spells here when their own stadium was unavailable. There are plans to expand it to 92,000 capacity by removing the running track, but this would end its Olympic prospects.\n\n Basketball \nIstanbul also has a major basketball presence, with seven clubs set to play the 2024–25 season in the men's Basketbol Süper Ligi. Several are basketball sections of major football clubs.\n\nFenerbahçe is one of two BSL clubs that have permanent licenses to compete in the EuroLeague, the continent's top men's club competition. It plays home games at the Ülker Sports and Event Hall (Fenerbahçe Ülker Spor ve Etkinlik Salonu) in the Ataşehir district, a few kilometers from the club's main base. Fenerbahçe also boasts a competitive women's basketball section, which also plays in the Ülker arena.\n\nThe other permanent EuroLeague participant is the standalone basketball club Anadolu Efes, playing at the city's largest indoor arena, Sinan Erdem Dome (Sinan Erdem Spor Salonu) in the Ataköy quarter of the Bakırköy district on the city's European side.\n\nAlso competing in the BSL are Bahçeşehir (which shares its arena with Fenerbahçe), Beşiktaş, Büyükçekmece, Darüşşafaka, and Galatasaray (which shares its arena with Anadolu Efes)"

Nanluoguoxiang primarily offers snack shops and can become extremely crowded—during peak hours, you'll often find yourself weaving through throngs of people. Despite the crowds, the lively atmosphere and excellent people-watching make it a worthwhile visit. In the evenings, Nanluoguoxiang transforms into a bustling night market, serving as an alternative to the once-famous Wangfujing night market, though it lacks some of the tourist-oriented specialty items like scorpion skewers. Qianmen Street and the nearby Dashilar Commercial Street in Xicheng District are also crowded pedestrian streets but have stores with old traditional brands to explore while walking along the path. Qianmen Street and the nearby Dashilar Commercial Street in the Xicheng District are also crowded pedestrian areas. These streets feature stores with old traditional brands, allowing you to explore Beijing's commercial heritage as you stroll along the path.\nHiking, camping, and tobogganing on the Great Wall: \nThere are numerous hiking options available on the Great Wall, with various tours and groups offering guided experiences, such as the well-established but expensive tour operator Beijing Hikers. The unrestored Jiankou section, although dangerous, is often considered the most beautiful. Many of the \"wild\" sections of the Wall are ideal for both hiking and camping.\nA recommended overnight camping spot can be arranged by visiting the village of Chenjiapu in Yanqing District, where the Chen family at Great Wall Fresh offers homestays and tent rentals. Alternatively, just further west of Chenjiapu village in Huailai County, in the neighboring province of Hebei, you can find an empty 1 km stretch of restored Wall and bring your own tent.\nAt the Mutianyu section in Huairou District, there is even a toboggan rail slide that allows visitors to ride down the Great Wall in a wheelless sled.\nBike through the hutongs: Exploring the remaining hutongs by bicycle is a fantastic way to experience Beijing firsthand. See above for bike rental information. Cesar from Barcelona, a top hutong aficionado, organizes biking tours of the hutongs in English and Spanish.\nGet a foot massage Have a highly enjoyable and relaxing foot massage and/or pedicure etc (for a fraction of the price in the West) from any of the respectable and professional offerings in central Beijing (in the vicinity of the Beijing Hotel for example).\n\nTheaters and concert halls\nThe National Centre for the Performing Arts in Xicheng District offers a variety of performances including opera, music, and theatre. Even if you don't attend a performance, the egg shaped building itself is worth a visit. The exterior is made from a steel oval structure that includes over 18,000 titanium plates and 1,000 sheets of ultra-white glass.\n\nThe Beijing Opera is considered the most famous of all the traditional opera performed around China. This kind of opera is nothing like western opera with costumes, singing style, music and spectator reactions being distinctly Chinese. The plot is usually quite simple, so you might be able to understand some of what happens even if you do not understand the language. Some of the best places to watch Beijing Opera are found in Xicheng District including Huguang Huguang Theatre and Lao She Teahouse. There are also a number in Dongcheng District including Chang'an Grand Theatre.\n\nAcrobatics shows are also worth a visit if you want to see some traditional Chinese entertainment. Some of the best shows are found in Tianqiao Acrobatics Theatre in Xicheng District and in Chaoyang Theatre in Chaoyang District.\n\nDrama plays have had a slow start in Beijing and are still not as widespread as you might expect for a city like Beijing, and you will most likely not be able to find many Western plays. However, some good places for contemporary Chinese plays do exist including Capital Theatre in Dongcheng District and Century Theater in Chaoyang District.\n\nClassical music has got a much stronger foothold in Beijing than drama plays. Some of the best places to go are the National Centre for the Performing Arts and the Century Theater both mentioned above as well as Beijing Concert Hall in Xicheng District."

OnBoat charter boats in Los Angeles has numerous choices. See https://onboat.co/los-angeles-yacht-charter/\n\nBeaches\nThe Westside is home to the most famous beaches of LA: Venice Beach, with its colorful Boardwalk and Muscle Beach, and the adjacent town of Santa Monica, with its popular pier and amusement park. Both communities share an expansive stretch of sandy beach which gets very crowded in the summer and which have plenty of amusements and facilities available, as well as a very festive scene in Venice that's fantastic for people watching.  Just south of Venice is the less-crowded Dockweiler State Beach in the aptly-named town of Playa del Rey (Spanish for beach of the king). Further north, where the coastline meets the Santa Monica Mountains, are scenic beaches in Pacific Palisades and Malibu; Pacific Palisades' Will Rogers State Beach is expansive and quite popular, while Malibu's narrower Surfrider Beach is famed for its surf breaks.\n\nSouth Bay is home to a number of beaches that are also very popular, in particular the Beach Cities of Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach, and Redondo Beach, with piers and expansive stretches of sand lined with expensive houses. Hermosa is famed for its festive atmosphere, regularly holding volleyball tournaments and surfing competitions, and all three are popular with families and beach-goers. Also good but less crowded is Torrance Beach further south, which is noted for great surfing, and the very scenic stretch of coastline in Palos Verdes, which holds many rocky coves and tidepools that make for fun exploration.\n\nOff the coast and enormously popular for people taking a day trip out of L.A. are the picturesque beaches of Catalina Island. Additionally, the Beach Cities of nearby Orange County are very popular with locals.  For those who are more into boats than sand, Marina del Rey is located just south of Venice and is the world's largest man-made small-craft harbor, offering plenty of mooring as well as motorized and non-motorized rentals.\n\nSports\nthumb|300px|Crypto.com Arena, when it was known as Staples Center\n\nLos Angeles has great opportunities for seeing live pro sports. The Major League Baseball Los Angeles Dodgers are one of the most famous teams in baseball and a game at Dodger Stadium in Elysian Park, in the hills north of downtown, is an absolute treat for baseball fans. However, LA's most successful sports franchise has been and remains the Los Angeles Lakers of the NBA, undoubtedly one of the greatest basketball teams in history. They play at Crypto.com Arena in Downtown, which they shared with another NBA team, the much less successful Los Angeles Clippers, before the Clippers moved to the new Intuit Dome in Inglewood in 2024. Also playing at Crypto.com Arena are the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League and the Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA. The city has two Major League Soccer teams—the LA Galaxy, which plays at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, and Los Angeles FC, which started play in 2018 at BMO Stadium in Exposition Park. Angel City FC started play in the National Women's Soccer League in 2022, playing in LAFC's stadium.\n\nThe National Football League now has two teams in the L.A. area, both having returned to the area after having spent decades elsewhere. The Los Angeles Rams, which called L.A. home from 1946 to 1994 before moving to St. Louis, returned to L.A. in 2016. The Los Angeles Chargers, which started their life in the old American Football League in 1960,  moved to San Diego the next year and didn't return until 2017. Both teams share SoFi Stadium in Inglewood. For the second-largest city in the country, Los Angeles long showed an inexplicable inability to hold down a NFL franchise; during the Rams' stint in St. Louis, Los Angeles football fans made do with the local college teams: the USC Trojans football team plays in the Coliseum, while the UCLA Bruins play in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, which also hosts the annual famous college bowl game the stadium is named after.\n\nIn addition, Major League Baseball's Los Angeles Angels and the National Hockey League's Anaheim Ducks play in nearby Anaheim in Orange County.\n\nMajor college sports in L.A. aren't limited to USC and UCLA, although those schools have by far the highest profiles since they're the only two NCAA Division I schools in the area that play football. The immediate L.A. area boasts seven other Division I programs. The city of Los Angeles boasts the Cal State Northridge Matadors (or CSUN Matadors) in the San Fernando Valley district of Northridge and the Loyola Marymount Lions in Westchester, while Los Angeles County also boasts the Pepperdine Waves just outside the Malibu city limits and the Long Beach State teams, known as The Beach. Orange County is home to the Cal State Fullerton Titans and UC Irvine Anteaters, while the Inland Empire city of Riverside is home to the UC Riverside Highlanders and the California Baptist Lancers.\n\nThe USA Sevens, the country's annual event in the SVNS, the current incarnation of World Rugby's series for men's and women's national teams in rugby sevens, returned to Dignity Health Sports Park in the 2023–24 season. Rugby sevens is a variant of rugby union played on a full-sized field, but with seven players per side instead of 15, and halves of 7 minutes instead of 40. The short duration of each game allows a complete tournament to be held over a single weekend. Both the men's and women's tournaments feature 12 teams, and the event strongly encourages a festival atmosphere.\n\nMusic\nthumb|350px|Walt Disney Concert Hall\nNo matter what music you're into, Los Angeles will feature artists to your taste, be it rock venues on Sunset Blvd, jazz clubs in Hollywood, or classical music in Downtown, just to scratch the surface. From the ambiance of the famous Hollywood Bowl to the spectacle of seeing a concert with 90,000 of your closest friends in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, L.A. has many venues that are worth exploring.\n\nDowntown Los Angeles holds several major entertainment venues. The 7,100-seat Microsoft Theater has become L.A.'s premiere venue for rock concerts and awards shows, while the nearby Staples Center, though primarily a sports venue, also hosts a large number of big-name concerts with its 19,000-seat capacity. Near the Civic Center, the Los Angeles Music Center consists of four music halls, most notably the Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall, home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Los Angeles Master Chorale, and the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, home to the Los Angeles Opera.\n\nGriffith Park holds the Greek Theatre, an outdoor amphitheater modeled after a Greek temple that hosts many concerts. Nearby Hollywood has two major concert venues in the Hollywood Palladium and the Fonda Theatre, the latter of which is reputed for its indie band scene and both of which regularly host big-name acts. A little further south, Wilshire has a couple of classic rock concert venues at the El Rey Theatre and The Wiltern. West Hollywood is home to some legendary rock nightclubs along the Sunset Strip, like Troubadour, Whisky a Go Go, and The Viper Room. Next to the USC campus and near Exposition Park in South Central L.A. is the Shrine Auditorium, a large enclosed amphitheater that holds over 6,000 people and regularly hosts large concerts and stage shows. In Inglewood, The Forum regularly hosts concerts as well as the occasional sports event.\n\nLos Angeles also has an abundance of records stores scattered around the city, and though vinyl has disappeared from the shelves of most regular record stores, there are still plenty of stores that sell new and used vinyl. Amoeba Music in Hollywood is without a doubt the best in the city. An exploration of underground music could begin at The Smell in Downtown or listen to KXLU 88.9 FM Monday-Friday for details on numerous shows.\n\nTheater\nthumb|350px|Inside the Pantages Theatre\nLos Angeles is a major center for stand-up and improvisational comedy, rivaling New York City given its proximity to the Hollywood industry and innovative scene; L.A. has become the undisputed center for comedy podcasts. There are many excellent comedy venues in town, but a few consistently rise to the top. The Comedy Store is a legendary venue in West Hollywood on the Sunset Strip that gave rise to many of the biggest names in the 1970s and still hosts the occasional nationally recognized comic. Also on the Sunset Strip is the Laugh Factory, which consistently features plenty of big-name comics. Elsewhere in West Hollywood you'll find the Largo at the Coronet, a very popular venue that emphasizes the intersection between comedy and live music and regularly hosts podcast shows. Another renowned spot is the Upright Citizens Brigade in Hollywood, which has cultivated some of the best comics in the industry today and dominates L.A.'s improv and experimental comedy scene. Another pair of great improv venues are the Improv and The Groundlings, two popular clubs on Melrose Avenue in Fairfax.\n\nVenues for stage productions abound in L.A., with the largest concentration being in Downtown. Along Broadway within Downtown's Historic Core, the Theater District is full of old movie palaces that have been converted to performance spaces and concert halls. In Civic Center, the Ahmanson Theatre of the Los Angeles Music Center is the city's main venue for plays, while the Music Center's Mark Taper Forum is a prominent venue for experimental theater. The historic Pantages Theatre in Hollywood is the place to see Broadway musicals in town. Near the Hollywood Bowl is the Ford Theatre, a historic outdoor amphitheater that puts on community theater productions. Out in Westwood, the UCLA-affiliated Geffen Playhouse is noted for their original productions.\n\nEvents\nthumb|250px|4th of July at the Hollywood Bowl\nBefitting its size, Los Angeles plays host to many major events throughout the year, from large conventions and spectacular holiday celebrations to more low-key neighborhood festivals. Whenever you come, you can be assured that something will be happening. What follows is just a sampling of the biggest annual events that take place in L.A.\n\nEvery January 1st, the New Year is rung in with the Tournament of Roses Parade, a massively popular parade in Pasadena with dozens of marching bands and elaborate floats before the famed Rose Bowl football game. Chinese New Year celebrations are held throughout the city in early February, with the biggest taking place in Chinatown with a dragon parade, live music, food, and firecrackers. March brings the L.A. Marathon, a massive event in which thousands of runners make their way from Dodger Stadium to Santa Monica. The popular Fiesta Broadway event takes place in Downtown on the last Sunday of April and is billed as the largest Cinco de Mayo celebration in the world, with lots of Mexican food, music, and pinatas.\n\nMemorial Day weekend marks the start of summer, and is marked by a tribute at the Battleship USS Iowa in San Pedro. Summer brings many of the city's biggest cultural festivals, such as Film Independent's Los Angeles Film Festival in June, West Hollywood's massive celebration of LGBT culture during Pride Week, and Little Tokyo's Nisei Week Japanese Festival in mid-August. Summer also sees many major conventions and expositions, including the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in June and Anime Expo in July, both of which are held at the Los Angeles Convention Center in Downtown. The Fourth of July is celebrated with lots of events across the city, most notably a spectacular fireworks show set to live music at the Hollywood Bowl.\n\nIn the fall, the Los Angeles County Fair takes place every September with concerts, carnival rides and agricultural exhibits in Pomona out in the San Gabriel Valley. Halloween brings lots of horror-themed events across the city, most notably the wildly popular West Hollywood Halloween Carnaval. After Thanksgiving, the holiday season kicks off with the Hollywood Christmas Parade, with plenty of elaborate floats, classic cars, and celebrity appearances. Other popular events during the holiday season include the Marina del Rey Holiday Boat Parade and a popular Christmas Eve music show in Downtown at the L.A. County Holiday Celebration."

        "do": " Do \n\n thumb|300px | NASCAR race at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez\nAs the world's second largest city, Mexico City offers something for everyone and for every budget.\nAttractions in Mexico City focus less on lazing on the beach (there are no beaches in Mexico City!) and more on exploring the culture and urban culture of Mexico. The typical \"must-see\" sites for the foreign visitor are the sites of interest in and around Centro Historico and Chapultepec Park, a visit to the ruins of Teotihuacan in the outskirts of the city and probably a visit to Xochimilco, though there are many other things to see if you have time to really explore.\n\n Itineraries \n Traveling in Mexico City with children\n\n Seasonal celebrations \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nAmusement parks\n\n \n\n Sports \n\nIf you're into sports, then Mexico City has plenty to offer. Soccer is the national sport and Mexicans go crazy about it. The city was host to two FIFA world cups, one in 1970 and the other in 1986. Another important sport in Mexico City is baseball, with many Mexicans playing professionally in the US. The city was the first in Latin America to host an Olympics, doing so in 1968; the majority of the city's sport facilities were built for that event.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n Lucha libre \nthumb|Lucha libre in Arena Mexico\nLucha libre (loosely translated as \"free fighting\") is the term for the style of professional wrestling that developed in Mexico. Due to its affordable and entertaining nature, it is a favorite pastime throughout the country. While similar to professional wrestling elsewhere in that the outcomes are predetermined, it developed quite differently from wrestling in the rest of the world. Wrestlers, known in Mexico as luchadores (female: luchadoras), tend to work much faster than those in the rest of North America, employing complex chains of moves, numerous high-flying maneuvers, and often-realistic submission holds. Also, rings in Mexico often lack the spring supports used in many other countries, which means that wrestlers typically don't take falls landing on their back as they often do elsewhere. More often than not, aerial moves involve wrestlers launching themselves outside of the ring at their opponents, allowing them to break the fall by tumbling. Finally, Mexican wrestling has far more weight classes than in other countries.\n\nAnother hallmark of lucha libre is the emphasis on tag team matches, which are most often made up of three-wrestler teams instead of the pairs that are common elsewhere. Rules for tag team matches are also significantly different.\n\nPerhaps the most distinctive feature of lucha libre is the colorful masks worn by many performers. While the concept of the wrestling mask was borrowed from the U.S., it has become infused with the role that masks have long played in Mexican culture. Almost all luchadores will begin their careers wearing them, but most will lose their masks at some point in their careers. The biggest matches in lucha libre are luchas de apuestas (\"betting fights\"), in which wrestlers will bet their masks, hair, or even their careers on the outcomes.\n\n \n \n\n Concerts \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Out of town trips\n\n  – 28 km away from the city you can find yourself surrounded by trees in the middle of the forest.

    "Bangkok": {
        "do": "Do\n\nFestivals\n300px|thumbnail|Launching a krathong down a pond\nAll of Thailand's major festivals are celebrated in Bangkok. New Year is celebrated three times. There's the new year following the Gregorian calendar at January 1, celebrated with a huge fireworks display at Ratchaprasong intersection. Then there's Chinese New Year in January or February, with grandiose and colourful Chinese lion and dragon processions in Yaowarat. Finally, the water festivities of Songkran celebrate the traditional Thai New Year in the middle of April. Khao San Road degenerates into a war zone as farangs and locals duke it out with super soakers. More respectable celebrations are held at Sanam Luang, where the revered Phra Phuttha Sihing image is displayed and bathed by devotees, and at the Wisut Kasat intersection, where a Miss Songkran beauty contest is held and accompanied by merit-making and entertainment.\n\nDuring the Royal Ploughing Ceremony in May, farmers believe that an ancient Brahman ritual, conducted at Sanam Luang, is able to forecast whether the coming growing season will be bountiful or not. The event dates back to the Sukhothai Kingdom and was re-introduced in 1960 by King Bhumibol Adulyadej. It is considered the official commencement of the rice-growing season (and the rainy season). Nowadays, the ceremony is conducted by King Maha Vajiralongkorn. Loi Krathong (ลอยกระทง), the Festival of Lights, usually takes place in November. Krathongs are floating rafts made from lotus flowers and banana leaves with a lighted candle and incense on top. On the night of the full moon, Thais send their krathong down a river, canal or pond, and the owner's bad luck carries away along with it insuring a fresh start. Celebrations take place all over town with parades, concerts and beauty pageants. Loi Krathong coincides with the Lanna festival Yi Peng (ยี่เป็ง). At this festival, a multitude of Lanna-style paper lanterns are launched into the air. Lumphini Park is the best place to launch a krathong down the pond or to launch a paper lantern into the sky.\n\nThe Trooping of the Colours in early December is an impressive annual event, held in the Royal Plaza near the equestrian statue of King Rama V in Dusit. Dressed in colourful uniforms, amid much pomp and ceremony, members of the elite Royal Guards swear allegiance to the King and march past members of the Royal Family. December 5 is Father's Day, the former King's birthday, and Ratchadamri Road and the Grand Palace are elaborately decorated and illuminated.\n\nCanals\n\nUntil the late 19th century, Bangkok (just like Ayutthaya) was known as \"Venice of the East\". Most people lived near or on the water and an intricate network of canals (khlong) was the primary mode of transport for the city's inhabitants. Most canals have since been paved over, but plenty of them remain and some still function as transport routes as of this day. The traditional canal-side way of life has almost vanished, but as Thonburi was largely undeveloped until the 20th century, there is still some authenticity to be found. Floating markets had completely disappeared by the 20th century, but have been reinstated for tourism purposes and are a fun visit.\n\nYou can see the Chao Phraya River and the backwaters of the city by canal tour. Most of these boat trips start at the eastern bank of the Chao Phraya and then ply through the backwaters of Thonburi taking in Wat Arun, the Royal Barges National Museum, a floating market and some other minor attractions. More information about these canal tours can be found in the Thonburi article. At 1,000 baht or more, they are quite expensive. You can also negotiate a price with individual boat drivers. Damnoen Saduak is a floating market that often appears in tourist brochures of Bangkok, but in practice it is  west of Bangkok and has to be visited by bus from the Southern Bus Terminal.\n\nProbably just as fun is to take the public express boat along the Chao Phraya River. You can get off anywhere between the Thewet and Sathorn (Taksin) piers as there are many things to see in all of these neighbourhoods. You can even take the express boat all the way north to Nonthaburi in the morning, enjoy the afternoon in this laid-back traditional urban town, and take the boat back around rush hour. Another option is to get on one of the free hotel shuttle boats at Sathorn (Taksin) pier and have a bite at one of the associated cafés. In the evenings, Asiatique has a free shuttle boat from Sathorn (Taksin) pier to the new shopping centre downriver. A good place to see beautiful sunsets over the river.\n\nPampering\n300px|thumbnail|Thai massage in Bangkok\nSpas, traditionally, were towns where public baths, hospitals or hotels were built on top of mineral springs so that people could come and make use of the healing properties found in the water and its mud for medical purposes. These days, a spa doesn't have to be a town built on natural thermal springs. It can be a place anywhere that anyone can go to, to relax in tranquil surroundings with a variety of treatment administered to recontour and rejuvenate the body and mind.\n\nSpas were unheard of until the 1990s, but now Bangkok is one of the highest ranking spa destinations in the world with an amazing array of treatments. All self-respecting luxury hotels in Bangkok have a spa that at least offers a traditional Thai massage. Prices are exorbitant, but they offer some of the best treatments in the city. Well-regarded spas at exceptionally high rates are given at the splurge hotels in Silom; particularly the spa at the Dusit Thani Hotel stands out. Independent spas offer much the same experience, but offer much more competitive rates. Figure around 1,000 baht/hr for most treatments.\n\nThe ubiquitous little massage shops found on every street corner in town offer the best value for money, but the smallest range of services, with offerings usually limited to massage only. Particularly Khao San Road and Sukhumvit have plenty of these popular places. It is fairly easy to distinguish legitimate massage shops from more dubious places (where massaging is only a front for prostitution); the real deal will charge 250-400 baht for a typical 2-hr massage and will often have a row of beefy farmers' daughters in white coats working on customers' feet in public view, while the other kind has wispy girls in evening dresses wearing too much make-up and saying \"hello handsome\" to every passing male.\n\nMuay Thai\n\nMuay Thai is both a combat sport and a means of self-defence. Contestants are allowed to use almost any part of the body for fighting: feet, elbows, legs, knees and shoulders. There are two venues in Bangkok to see this sport in action: Lumpinee Boxing Stadium in Silom and Ratchadamnoen Stadium in Rattanakosin. Sessions can take the whole evening and it's not that bad if you come in slightly late as the more interesting fights tend to happen at the end. The playing of traditional music during the bouts is enjoyable as well. A downer is the steep 1,000-2,000 baht entry fee for foreigners. Thais chip in for 100 baht or less.\n\nIf you want to see Muay Thai for free, go to the MBK Fight Night outside MBK Center near Siam Square. Fights take place the last Wednesday evening of each month (starts at 18:00, lasts until around 21:00). Another option is to walk to the end of Soi Rambuttri into an alley known as Trok Kasap (near Khao San Road). Foreigners are getting classes in Muay Thai out in the open there, and many tourists generally sit on a bench in front of it to look at the action. Besides looking, this is an excellent place to do some Muay Thai yourself.\n\nCycling\nBicycles can be rented for free in Rattanakosin, but cyclists are officially not allowed to leave the set route along the island. Even when following the route, it's still not for the faint of heart.\n\nIf renting your own bicycle, avoid the main roads and cycle through the vast system of small streets and alleys. You can cycle through the backstreets of Yaowarat, but you might want to think twice before making a turn. You can also experience life in Bangkok's countryside by cycling through green paddy fields, orchid farms and lotus fields. Bang Kachao, in brochures often referred to as the \"Bangkok Jungle\", is Bangkok's last green frontier. It's a semi-island across the river from Bangkok with few cars and buildings, and a great destination for cycling.\n\nCyclists are treated as pedestrians, so you can use your bicycle to explore parks, temple complexes, markets and the more quiet residential areas in eastern Bangkok. In more crowded places you can cycle on the pavement. Exploring by bicycle has all the advantages of going by foot, combined with a much greater travel radius and a cooling breeze. Cycling is the best way to discover the city up close, but as there are safety issues involved, you need some insider knowledge on where to cycle. Because of this, many opt for a bicycle tour organised by an operator.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nTheatre\n\nThe Aksra Theatre in the King Power Complex Building in Pratunam holds spectacular shows that are a combination of Thai traditional puppet shows, orchestral performances and classical dances. The Joe Louis Theatre in the Asiatique is completely dedicated to the art of operating Hun Lakhon Lek puppets. One segment has the puppets interact with audience members, which is a fun activity with children. Both Aksra and Joe Louis feature stories taken from the Ramayana epic.\n\nOf a completely different nature are Bangkok's famous transvestite shows. These cabarets generally take about 2 hours, and besides singing, dancing, glamour and costumes, there's also has some comedy thrown in. The most famous of these is the Calypso Cabaret at Ratchathewi intersection with two sessions every evening at the Asia Hotel. An alternative is Mambo Cabaret, once in Sukhumvit but now at a new location far off the tourist path in Yan Nawa. Three shows are given each evening. Always book these shows a couple of days in advance as they usually sell out.\n\nEntertainment\n\nBangkok is a great place to go to the cinema. Compared to Western countries, the cost of a ticket is a complete bargain at around 120 baht. Most cinemas have world-class standards and show the latest Hollywood and Thai releases. They are up to par with the latest technological innovations in the film industry, so expect to wear 3D glasses for some of the latest Hollywood releases. You can also visit the IMAX Theatre in Siam Paragon. Thai films can be seen by foreigners as they are usually shown with English subtitles. For non-mainstream cinema, House Samyan (in Samyan Mitrtown shopping mall) and APEX (in Siam Square) offer art films with English subtitles.\n\nFor other means of entertainment, Ratchadaphisek is a newly created entertainment paradise. Its bowling centres are of a superb standard with some of them resembling the interior of a nightclub. Dance while you play in style. Private karaoke lounges are usually connected to these bowling centres and are available at major hotels. There's even an ice skating rink and a top-class go-kart track in this district. As Ratchadaphisek is mostly aimed at locals, you might want to go to similar venues in Siam Square or Sukhumvit. Horse races are held on Sundays at two alternate turf clubs: the Royal Turf Club of Thailand in Dusit and the Royal Bangkok Sports Club on Henri Dunant Road near Siam Square.\n\n Aerobics dance \nBangkok is a good place for aerobics dancing. Many places in Bangkok, for example, supermarkets or public parks, offer free outdoor aerobics classes. These classes usually start in the morning at 06:00 or in the evening at 18:00, and the session would last for one hour. Wear appropriate clothing. These classes don't require Thai language skill because instructor rarely uses verbal cues. Aside from exercising you can also meet the community of local people and foreigners.\n\nFor supermarkets, you can expect to find classes in Lotus or Big C. They only have classes in the evening, and are usually held in or nearby the parking areas. For public parks, there are many places but the most famous one is in the Lumphini park in Silom district. They have classes in the morning and in the evening at the ceremonial gate."

While it's not the most pleasant experience, the benefits you'll receive afterward will enable you to understand why Russians are loyal to their banya.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCircuses\n \n\n \n\nTheatres\n \n\nIce skating\n \n\n \n\nThe winter rinks at Chistye Prudy or Izmaylovsky Park are other alternatives.\n\nOther\n Sun of Moscow, Europe's tallest ferris wheel (140 m height); opened in 2022.\n\n Watch football: Moscow has four teams playing in the Premier League, the top tier of Russian football. They often qualify for European tournaments, and their stadiums are used for international games. The four are:\n FC Locomotiv Moscow play at RZD Stadium, completed in 2002 with a capacity of 27,000. It's in the northeast of the city, use metro station Locomotiv (aka Cherkizovskaya) on Circle Line 14 and Red Line 1.\n PFC CSKA Moscow play at VEB Arena, completed in 2016 with a capacity of 30,000.

São Paulo has a great number of theaters, most of which feature plays in Portuguese. The British Cultural Centre, Goethe Institute, Instituto Cervantes and Alliance Française occasionally have plays in English, German, Spanish and French, respectively; check individual District listings.\n\nCiclofaixa de Lazer\n\nThe Ciclofaixa de Lazer (Leisure Cycling Lane) comprises dozens of kilometers of interconnected cycling lanes, in the central, south and west areas of the city, that are available on Sundays and some holidays, between 07:00-16:00. It interconnects most places of interest of the city - Downtown, Avenida Paulista, Parque do Ibirapuera, University of São Paulo, the Pinheiros river business centers and the Guarapiranga reservoir, although certainly not using the shortest paths. Bicycle borrowing and renting is available at Parque das Bicicletas (in Parque do Ibirapuera) and at Praça do Ciclista (at Avenida Paulista), but try to get a bicycle in advance if possible.\n\nSince the cycling route is family-oriented, signaling and safety standards are high. The route is stricly intended for recreational, not sportive cycling, so set your speed accordingly in the presence of other cyclists. A full map of the route, as well as other useful information, are available here.\n\nFun for the family\nBoth adults and kids are ensured to have fun by seeing the animals in the São Paulo Zoo and in the São Paulo Aquarium (see São Paulo/Southeast). São Paulo also has educative spaces aimed both at adults and children, including Catavento Cultural (see São Paulo/Downtown) and Espaço Ciência (see São Paulo/West). Finally, Mundo da Xuxa (see São Paulo/South Central) is a theme park only for the small ones.\n\nWatch football\n\nthumb|center|500px|Estádio Cícero Pompeu de Toledo (Morumbi), Brazil's third largest football stadium.\n\nFootball (soccer) is an inherent part of Brazilian culture, and São Paulo is no exception, being home of four football teams that generally run in the 1st division: Corinthians, São Paulo, Palmeiras and Portuguesa. The five large football stadiums in the city are Morumbi, Allianz Parque (see São Paulo/West), Pacaembu (see São Paulo/Historic Center), Arena Corinthians (also popularly known as \"Itaquerão\") and Canindé (see São Paulo/Southeast). A word of warning, however: although most matches are safe and fun events, games between the biggest local rivals (Corinthians, São Paulo, Palmeiras and, to a smaller extent, Santos) have had episodes of violence flaring up (in the majority of cases, such incidents happen outside of the stadium), due to a number of violent fans (ultras). The Derby Paulista in particular being Palmeiras and Corinthians is ranked among the most intense in the world. Going to such games can be a risky proposition. Portuguesa games are safe, have few supporters, and are very peaceful and curious (meets the Portuguese community in the city).\n\nCity tours\nSão Paulo Historical City Tour is a panoramic tour for those keen to have an introduction to the history, culture, and the lifestyle of the biggest city in the Southern Hemisphere. The city tour takes about 3 hours, during which the visitor will pass by places in São Paulo's Old Centre and get familiar with attractions such as the Cathedral of Sé, Pátio do Colégio (short stop at the square, the site where the city was founded), Monastery of São Bento, the Banespa Building (São Paulo’s answer to the Empire State Building), the Martinelli Building (the first skyscraper in South America), Viaduto do Chá (Tea Viaduct), the Municipal Theater, Sala São Paulo concert hall, Estaçao da Luz train station and the Municipal Market.\n  \n\nEvents\nAccording to the São Paulo Convention & Visitors Bureau, São Paulo hosts 90,000 events a year, from meetings and conferences to sports and cultural events. Events tied to a particular region are listed in the individual district sections. The following events are considered important to the city as a whole:\nthumb|right|250px|The São Paulo Carnaval.\n\n \n \n \n Brazilian Grand Prix is a Formula One motor race held at Autódromo José Carlos Pace in the  Interlagos district to the south. It's held in November."

The British-designed colonial equivalent of a shopping mall, it's laid out in two concentric rings divided into blocks, all bursting with shops and lots of pampered pigeons waddling about. Long neglected, the area received an upsurge after the opening of the major Metro junction of Rajiv Chowk under it, and it's going more upmarket by the day. At the centre is a small but pleasant park, while on one edge is the notorious Palika Bazaar, an underground den of cheap wares, many pirated or smuggled from overseas. The area is surrounded by tall office buildings on nearly all sides. Train fans will want to check out the Metro Museum inside the (Patel Chowk) station, open Tu-Su 10AM-4PM (free with valid Metro ticket)."

They are actually a unique assimilation of various domestic and international races from the Chinese to the Portuguese, which makes it distinct from other parts of Indonesia. The Lenong theatre performance is accompanied by the Gambang Kromong orchestra that consists of the Sundanese Gendang, the Javanese Gamelan, and the Chinese Kongahyan (its own version of violin). The Tanjidor trumpets are an influence from the Dutch, while the Portuguese bequeathed the Keroncong orchestra. At the anniversary of the city's founding every 22 June, a distinctive piece of culture can be seen in hotels, the infamous pair of Ondel-ondel puppets. The complete experience of the culture can be found at Setu Babakan, the village of Betawi culture (and fishing at its lake).\n\nCinema\nCinemas are a more affordable escape at around Rp30,000 - 45,000 for a plush seat (Rp40,000 - 70,000 on the weekend, up to Rp150,000 if you watch in Premiere Class at XXI or Velvet Class at CGV Blitz) in any of the capital's shopping malls. Beware of the heavy hand of the Indonesian censor though. The price of popcorn and drinks are exorbitant so you may wish to bring your own coming in. CGV Blitz cinemas will typically show movies in any foreign language other than English and the lesser ones also exhibit Indonesian B-Movies with erotic themes (still heavily censored). The largest chain of cinemas in Indonesia are the 21 Cineplex (branded as XXI in premium shopping malls) and CGV Blitz. IMAX theaters are only available at Gandaria City's XXI theatre, Mal Kelapa Gading III's theatre and Keong Mas in TMII, although the latter more often shows documentary than blockbuster films.\n\nPerforming arts festivals\nJakarta boasts some of the world's largest music events, which may surprise you, and the many young fans have attracted artists all around the world to regularly stop by Jakarta as part of their world tour, from rock concerts to Korean pop. Perhaps the best known event is the annual Jakarta International Java Jazz Festival that takes place each March for 3 days, filled with over 40 international and local artists performing jazz, R&B and reggae songs. The Hammersonic is an annual metal music concert, while We The Fest boasts some of the performances from indie/pop artists in August since its first inception in 2014, Road to Soundrenaline takes you to the popular local indie/major label bands showcases, before it ends up in Bali for the main event with some of international artists performing there and the Djakarta Warehouse Project hosts world famous DJs to jam the start of the year-end holiday. For a street performance, the Sudirman-Thamrin strip is closed at night on 22 June and New Year's Eve, when stages for musical performances are erected and cultural parades set up to usher in Jakarta's founding anniversary and the New Year, respectively.\n\nFor some traditional and classical stuff, there are performances at Gedung Kesenian Jakarta, by indie, jazz, dance, and classical music orchestras. Taman Ismail Marzuki hosts mainly theatrical shows, although English shows might be rare. Erasmus Huis Hall by the Dutch embassy also regularly hosts classical music shows and photography exhibitions.\n\nSport\nThe sport scene in Jakarta is perhaps one of the most vibrant you'll ever see in Asia. The Senayan sports complex still lives up to its name since the 1962 Asian Games, where archery and indoor shooting range are also publicly available to try. Soemantri-Brodjonegoro in Kuningan district also offers you many kinds of sport activities. If you like skateboarding, Kalijodo Skatepark is the best place to meet others.\n\nGolf\nJakarta is perhaps the best city to play golf in Asia, thanks to the abundance of courses close to or even in the middle of the city, and relatively cheap prices compared to Western standards. Green fees can go as low as Rp70,000 on weekdays, although the better courses are twice that, and weekend rates are considerably steeper at Rp300,000 and more. Many golf courses are at South and East within the immediate suburbs of the city, much better in quality and quantity at the satellite cities.\n\nFootball\nIndonesia is one of the few Asian countries where European soccer teams, including from the prestigious British Premier League or the Italian League, play friendlies against the national team when the game itself is at break in Europe. The supporters between the national team and the Europeans at the Gelora Bung Karno Stadium are even, yet even though for the most part Indonesia's national team post losses, clashes do not seem to occur. When the European leagues are in season, numerous cafés and bars around town put up gigantic TV screens to let the enthusiasm erupt while having a drink at dawn.\n\nFutsal is the indoor version of football, which has 5 players per team and more lax rules of play. Anytime after work or on the weekends, you can easily find crowds at the many indoor courts across the city. Outdoors, the dirt and grass makeshift fields are abundant in residential areas, crowded with players, spectators and vendors, typically on weekend afternoons. In these casual games, anyone can simply ask to jump in.\n\nBadminton\nAs a badminton powerhouse, Jakarta has a multitude of badminton courts, ranging from the national venues at the Senayan Complex to the suburban halls which cater to both futsal and badminton. Most of them have wood-panel flooring and are maintained in reasonably good condition. Lighting is strictly functional and is below par in comparison with standard badminton halls. People play almost every evening - so, walk in, strike up a conversation with the group's captain, and expect to blend in with their group for the session. If the captain refuses payment (usually less than Rp20,000), it is polite to buy the players a round of soft-drinks (Teh-botol is a good choice). Be warned that it is common for Indonesians to eat, smoke, drink and nap by the side of the court: so watch your step.\n\nIf you want to watch rather than to play, the Istora Senayan is packed in the middle of January for Indonesia Masters Super 500 and early June during the Indonesia Open Super 1000 (a Grand Slam equivalent in badminton), when the world's top badminton players compete. The deafening cheers are chanted even beyond when the players hit the shuttlecock, an enthusiasm unmatched elsewhere in the world. It is advised to buy tickets online (especially for the weekend matches), otherwise you may be relegated to watching it on the big screen outside the venue.\n\nKaraoke\nYou are in one of Asia's big cities—karaoke is the norm, so sing your heart out! Most chain brands such as Inul Vizta, NAV, or DIVA can be found at the upscale shopping malls where the youngsters play. You'll have your own lavish room with a wide span of libraries containing local, English, and East Asian songs, on a wide-screen TV while you can order a drink or food to be enjoyed while you wait your turn to sing. Rates can start from as low as Rp70,000 per room for a minimum of 6 people.\n\nBooks and Library\n\n The Jakarta Library  is government-run libraries that were renovated in July 2022. The architecture is now more modern and Instagram-friendly. These libraries are located within the same complex as Taman Ismail Marzuki  and can be accessed via the Cikini Commuter Line Staonti. Entrance is free.\n The National Library of Indonesia The National Library of Indonesia is located in Gambir, on the south side of  Merdeka Square , Jakarta. The new building, at 127 meters (417 feet) tall, is claimed to be the tallest library building in the world. Visitors can enjoy views of Jakarta and  Monas  from the 24th floor. It is accessible via the TransJakarta bus, Balai Kota stop . Entrance is free.\n Baca Di Tebet  Perpustakaan dan Ruang Temu (Read In Tebet Library and Meeting Room) is located on Jl. Tebet Barat Dalam Raya, Tebet Subdistrict, South Jakarta. This place combines a cozy reading space with a café featuring classic interiors. The daily entrance fee is Rp 35,000, not including food and drinks.\n Freedom Institute  is located on Jalan Rasuna Said, on the ground floor of Wisma Bakrie 1. This library houses a collection of 10,000 books, mostly in English, from various genres. It is accessible via the Setiabudi LRT Station. Entrance is free.\n Aksara Kemang   (Kemang script)  is a bookstore and café with modern interior design. It offers books by independent authors.\n Taman Literasi (Literacy Park) Martha Christina Tiahahu  is an open space park and reading area with a collection of books. The park also features many cafes and restaurants and is located in the Blok M area. It can be accessed via the Blok M MRT Station. Entrance is free.\n Bursa Buku (Book Exchange) Blok M  is a marketplace for both new and used books located in the basement of Blok M Square. Blok M was a popular cultural icon in Jakarta during the 1990s. It can be accessed via the Blok M Station."

Smoke a shisha water pipe (try the \"double apple\" flavor) and watch the world go by. Great cheap entertainment.\n\nFelucca\nRide a felucca along the Nile River. A great way to relax and enjoy a night under the stars in Cairo. Feluccas are available across from the Four Seasons Hotel in Garden City. To charter your own, negotiate a fair price of no more than LE20-30 for about a half hour for the boat, or LE50 for an hour, no matter how many people are on it. Pay after your ride, or you may get much less than you bargained for. Public boats with loud noisy music and a giggling crowd are also available for LE2 for 1/2 hour, but are very uncomfortable.\n\nParks\nCairo has a shortage of parks, but a few of them exist.\n\n The most famous is the Giza Zoo, which is in front of the Four Seasons Hotel in Giza. This is one of the oldest zoos in the world, opened in 1891.\n Hadiqat Al Orman (English: Al Orman Gardens), Giza. This is a fairly large park near the Giza Zoo. It can be entered by paying a daily ticket at the gate. It contains a variety of trees and flowers and is a nice place to escape the noise and traffic of the city. However, it may be very crowded with locals, especially on weekends and public holidays like Eid.\n Hadiqat Al Azbakiya (English: Al Azbakieya Gardens). Another nice park to enjoy the greenery and scenery of trees and gardens, while remaining inside the city. It is located in the Azbakiya area of Cairo, and the best option is to take a taxi.\n Genenet El Asmak (English: Garden of the Fish), Zamalek. A nice park, which also includes several large caves containing water aquariums, where you can see different species of fish and underwater life through glass windows. Like other parks, a very cheap ticket enables you to enter and enjoy the day there.\n Merryland (Arabic: Genenet El Merryland), in Heliopolis district near Roxy Cinema. Again, another park with trees and gardens and nice scenery, and there are restaurants and cafes in the park.\n El Hadiqa El Dawliya (English: the International Garden),  in Nasr City district. It was opened when Nasr City district was built in the 1960s. Sections of the park contain copies of famous buildings from around the world (i.e. the Eiffel Tower of Paris, Great Wall of China, the windmills of Holland). The copies are much smaller of course, similar to small statues. Interesting to see.\n Al-Azhar Park - has restaurants and entertainment available. It has a good vantage point of Islamic Cairo and the city skyline.\n You can also take a stroll along the Corniche el-Nil, and there is a river promenade on Gezira Island.\n Desert Park. Wadi Digla Protected Area is a 60-km² environmentally protected park near Ma'adi, that offers opportunity for taking a trek, jogging, rock climbing, and cycling. Wadi Degla is also a good spot for bird watching, and viewing the various reptile species, plants, and deer that reside there. You can take a cab from Ma'adi to the entrance at Wadi Delga. Cab drivers in Ma'adi should know where to go.\n\nRecreation\nOther options for relaxation include visiting the Giza Zoo and the Cairo Botanical Gardens, or watching horse racing at the Gezira Club in Zamalek, or, when you need a break from city life, try a round of golf on the famous Mena House Golf Course overlooking the Pyramids, or The Hilton Pyramids Hotel tournament golf course and nearby Sixth Of October City, Ten minutes drive from Giza Pyramids.\n\nOr if the family, and especially children are fed up looking at monuments and museums, a 10-minute trip from the Giza Pyramids by micro-bus, taxi, or car, will take you to two of the biggest and best theme parks in Cairo, Dream-park, and Magic land, both in nearby Sixth Of October City.\n\nMagic land is also part of The Media Production City complex, including The Mövenpick Hotel, where visitors can take a tour of the Egyptian TV and drama sets, and studios which house many of the Egyptian and other Arabic TV stations.\n\nShopping\nCitystars is Egypt's premier shopping mall and is quite comparable to a foreign mall. It offers most international brands and most international food chains. It offers a cinema and amusement park. Mall of Arabia is a brand new spacious shopping mall in the suburb of 6 October City. It is Cairo's other premier shopping destination, featuring many of the same American and European clothiers as Citystars.\n\n Sports \n Football: The national soccer team play at Cairo International Stadium in Nasr City 10 km east of the centre. Half the club teams in the Premier League, Egypt's top tier, are based in Cairo, so there will be several top-flight matches on any weekend October to April. Choose from Zamalek (also based at International Stadium), Al Ahly, Pyramids, Future, National Bank, ENPPI, Ceramica Cleopatra, El Geish, Al Mokawloon and East Company. \n Horse riding in the desert from one of the Nazlet El-Samaan stables such as FB Stables (contact Karim +20 106 507 0288 or visit the website) in Giza. Ride in the shadow of the Great Pyramids or further afield to Saqqara or Abu Sir or camp out over night with a barbecue and fire. Popular with expats who keep their horses at livery, FB Stables is also great for a 'tourist' type ride to view the Pyramids from the desert. Longer rides to Saqqara and Abu Seer can be arranged in advance, as can sunrise, sunset and full moon rides. Other than the horses and good company, one of the best things about FB is their amazing rooftop terrace (with BBQ) with unrivaled views over the Pyramids - a great place to relax with a drink whilst watching the Sound and Light show.\n\nMusic and culture\n Sufi dancing - The Al Tanura Troupe offers free performances every Saturday, Monday and Wednesday night at 8:30PM (7:30PM during winter) at the Al-Ghouri Mausoleum.

        "do": "Do\n\nFootball games\n\nArgentina has a renowned football reputation and the sport is big throughout the whole country including of course, Buenos Aires. The capital is the home town of two of the most appreciated football teams in the world, Boca Juniors (which resides in Boca) and River Plate (Núñez). A game between these two legendary teams is called the \"Superclásico\". This is by far the hottest ticket in the city and one of the most intense rivalries in the world, with violent confrontations between the fans being a regular occurrence, sometimes even resulting in fatalities. It is often necessary to buy tickets well in advance.\n\nAlso, the Argentine National Team is very, very popular. Tickets to their World Cup Qualifying matches can difficult to come by, involve waiting in very long lines, and should be ordered in advance for more convenience.\n\nArgentinian fans are known for their passion and the songs (which are practically love songs) which they sing to their teams. Even if you are not a huge football fan, going to a game is definitely worth it just to take in the atmosphere and to observe the fans singing and cheering. While this is an experience you don't want to miss while visiting Buenos Aires, it can also be dangerous for tourists to go on their own depending on the stadium.\n\nTourists are often advised to go with large, organized groups such as LandingPadBA with bilingual guides, in particular to a Boca Juniors game. This ensures that you can watch the game in peace and still have a great time. If you want to see a match on your own, the best choice is to see River Plate, in the rich northern suburb of Belgrano. Best to purchase a (more expensive, ~AR$900, 2018) Plateas (grandstand) ticket rather than being in the Populars (terraces, ~AR$350 prices, 2018).\n\nIn the Plateas you can safely take your camera and enjoy the show. Go with a friend or someone local you trust who knows not only the area but also supports the local side and is familiar with the way things operate on match day.\n\nPurchase tickets in advance or through a friend if they are a member of the club or supporters' section, also known as a socio. Often tickets are mainly sold out for the big times, but you can sometimes find them on sale on match day for teams like Racing, and as the ticket prices have risen only matches rarely sell out (except the above-mentioned Superclásico).\n\nTango\nthumb|250px|Tango in the streets of La Boca\n\nA trip to Buenos Aires is not complete without some sort of experience of the Tango, the national dance of Argentina. A good place to go and watch some authentic Tango is at the Confitería Ideal Suipacha 384 (just off of Corrientes, near Calle Florida). However Tango is best experienced not in La Boca and on Calle Florida, but in the Milongas. A milonga is both a place where a Tango dance will take place, as well as a specific type of tango dance.\n\nMilongas take place either during the day or late at night. \"Matinée Milongas\" usually start in the early afternoon and go until 20:00-22:00. They are popular with tourists who may struggle staying up until 05:00 every night. Inside a milonga, you will find many locals who will be more than willing to show you how to dance. The night Milongas start at around 23:00, but don't fill up until around 01:30. They may go on until 05:00 or 06:00. Some Milongas to note are: Salon Canning, El Beso and Porteño y Bailarin.\n\nThere are many milongas held in different parts of the city every day. There's a free distribution guide called TangoMap Guide which contains all the information of the milongas day by day, including times and location. This guide also informs about tango teachers and tango shops, so it's the best reference for any tango lover. It is edited by Caserón Porteño, a Tango Guest House in Buenos Aires that also gives free tango lessons every day for its guests.\n\nYou can start learning tango through the group lessons offered at many studios. Some popular schools are at the Centro Cultural Borges, on the very top floor. It can be very hard to find the actual place as there are some stairs you have to go up, and then you have to go through a museum. Ask the security officer where the \"Escuela de Tango\" is. In the summer time the rooms can get very hot. The Centro is within the Galerias Pacifico, the American-style mall near Calle Florida on San Martin. The best way to learn, and the quickest, even if you do not have a partner, is with private lessons. You can find instructors who charge as little as US$40 per hour, all the way up to ones that will charge US$100 per hour. If you want to try the authentic style that the Argentines dance socially in the milongas, look up some of the milongueros who teach tango, like Alejandro Gee, Juan Manuel Suarez, Jorge Garcia, Jorge Kero. They will not only teach you traditional tango or milonga, but you can also find out a lot about the culture by hanging out with them. You can google them up for videos or in order to find them. Many of the more 'famous' instructors command a premium price. If you start taking tango lessons it will seduce and consume your life and you will then be force to make many pilgrimages back to Buenos Aires to dance.\n\nIf you prefer to start taking lessons in reduced groups and have personal attention, there are two tango oriented hotels with professional tango teachers who offer group tango lessons every day (free for their guests). One option is Caserón Porteño and the other one Tango Lodge. You can check the complete schedule for the tango lessons at their websites.\n\nGaucho party\n\nSpend a night seeing what it is like to be a real gaucho. Live the life of an Argentine cowboy; ride horses, eat traditional gaucho foods, drink traditional gaucho wines, and dance like they used to do back in the day. A great way to get out of the city for a day and see another side of Argentine culture. Great for adults, kids, or anybody who ever wanted to be a cowboy when they were younger.\n\nSkydiving\n\nBuenos Aires hosts exhilarating skydiving activities within its clear blue skies. You can experience a 20-minute flight, followed by a 35 seconds freefall, and a slow descent of nearly 7 minutes to enjoy a breathtaking view. Discover a unique bird's-eye view of Buenos Aires and its expansive pampas as you dive through 3,000 meters (9,000 feet) of open air. There is no better place to feel the adrenaline of a tandem skydiving jump.\n\nWine events\n\nArgentina is renowned for its excellent selection of wine. The most popular being Mendoza which is rated among the world's most popular regions due to its high altitude, volcanic soils and proximity to the Andes Mountains. The terrain seems to complement the European grape varietals with interesting notes not present when produced in other climates, this allows the Argentine wine to be positioned in a league of its own.\n\nThe best way to experience and understand the selection of Argentine varietals is a wine tasting, which is offered by quite a few companies and bars around the city.\n\nPolo\n\nArgentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world. The largest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas. Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year. For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check Asociacion Argentina de Polo.\n\nAround Buenos Aires there are plenty of Polo schools. Most Polo courses run for a week and include accommodation on site. A popular option for a day-trip is Polo Elite, who operate polo lessons for beginners as well as guided trips to polo matches. They provide transportation for the 45min drive from downtown to their school.\n\nAnother option is Argentina Polo Day which runs professional polo games every day of the year, as well as polo lessons for beginners and pros. Its full day program includes also a typical Argentinean BBQ with unlimited wine and refreshment. The Polo Clinics includes also accommodation. Transportation is provided, for the 45 minutes drive from downtown to their polo ranch.\n\nPuesto Viejo Polo Days  is another option. These full day experiences collect participants from the city and take them to a luxury polo estancia in the countryside. They offer transport, snacks, Argentine lunch with wine, lesson, mini match, use of hotel infinity pool, and an opportunity to watch a full polo match.\n\nLGBT travellers\n\nBuenos Aires has become a popular destination among LGBT travellers. For international LGBT travellers, the \"Paris of the South\" has also become the gay capital of South America. Same-sex marriage is legal in the country and in the central districts you will find most people helpful and amiable. There are many gay-oriented services to help you make the best of your stay.\n\nIf you are looking for accommodations you can start by visiting BA4U Apartments which specializes in finding rentals for the LGBT community. They can also direct you to tours and services their clients use like Day Clicker Photo Tours . While you are visiting you might also want to stop in to see Chef Mun at the popular closed door restaurant Casa Mun.\n\nHelicopter tours\n\nThe city of Buenos Aires and its suburban surroundings cover a tremendous expanse of land that cannot be easily and quickly walked, biked, or driven. That is what helicopter rides are for. You can discover Buenos Aires from a unique perspective: see the skyline of Puerto Madero's skyscrapers, the grid of concrete streets filled with taxis and colectivos or buses, the tourist attractions including the Obelisco, Casa Rosada, and Cementario Recoleta. Tour the skies above the human traffic on an exciting helicopter ride, a different way to explore the city.\n\nGolf\n\nYou might not think of it as you walk around this big city of skyscrapers, but there is some very good golfing very close by. There are many trips to the golf courses that make it easy and relaxing for tourists to enjoy a day on the green. . Packages include any greens fees, equipment and a caddie who you can blame when you hook that shot into the woods!\n\nJewish travellers\n\nBuenos Aires is home to the biggest Jewish community in Latin America and one of the biggest in the world. There are many sights and activities specifically for Jewish people. There are beautiful synagogues, museums, monuments, barrios and history for all travellers to soak up and enjoy. Tours are given around the city to hit all the major Jewish landmarks. This is a great way to see a different side of Buenos Aires that many people wouldn't think about seeing.\n\nSpas\n\nUrban spas or day spas have flourished, some of them at large hotels such as the Alvear, Hilton, Hyatt among others. Furthermore, some green spas have opened shops and offer a great range of eco-friendly treatments.\n\nMedical tourism\n\nMaking medical procedures part of your overall vacation package is a growing trend, and since Buenos Aires is relatively affordable for Westerners, it is at the forefront. If you decide to go the medical vacation route, there are a number of firms that have established relationships with local medical clinics who can deliver a total package. Make sure you check out the credentials of the doctors and other healthcare professionals before making your decision. Buenos Aires is home to plenty of well-trained doctors with excellent reputations."

        "do": "Do\n\nCarnaval\nthumb|275px|right|Sambodrome at night, where thousands spend the night dancing, singing and celebrating their favorite samba school (comparable to soccer teams) till dawn\n\nStill the greatest reason for visiting Rio seems to be the Carnaval. This highly advertised party lasts for almost two weeks and it is well known for the escolas de samba (samba schools) that parade in Centro, on a gigantic structure called Sambódromo (Sambadrome). During Carnaval, Rio has much more to offer though, with the blocos de rua, that parade on the streets. There are now hundreds of these street \"samba blocks\", that parade almost in every neighborhood, especially in Centro and the South Zone, gathering thousands of people. Some are very famous, and there are few cariocas that have not heard of \"Carmelitas\", \"Suvaco de Cristo\", \"Escravos da Mauá\" or \"Simpatia É Quase Amor\".\n\nThe rest of the year, samba shows are popular with tourists, and are held at several venues like Plataforma and Scala. These are expensive and not really representative of Brazilian culture, they present a lot of almost naked women and bad musicians, a tourist trap (much like the real thing.) Much more interesting and genuine, though, are the night practice sessions held by the various samba schools in the months leading up to Carnaval. You will find only a small number of tourists here, and you will be served the best caipirinhas of your trip! These go on into the wee hours of the morning, with the fun really only starting at 1-2AM A good cab driver should be able to hook you up, and cabs will be available to take you back when you are samba-ed out. Salgueiro and Mangueira are good choices, as they are two of the larger samba schools, and are located relatively close to the tourist areas in a fairly safe area.\n\nA change is afoot that may make this genuine experience a thing of the past (or more convenient, depending on your viewpoint) for all but the most savvy tourists. The local government built a complex of buildings (Cidade do Samba) where many of the samba schools moved their practice halls and float-construction facilities from the gritty warehouses typically located in or near their home favelas. One can expect many more tourists, and shows made-up for the tourists as the tourist bureau milks this facility for all it's worth year-round.\n\n \n\nHere is a list of some of the samba schools:\n \n \n \n\nMusic\n\nRio was the cradle of three of Brazil's most important musical genres: samba, choro, and bossa nova. There has been a boom of traditional samba and choro venues. A lot of them are in the downtown district of Lapa. There are good and cheap nightlife options, where you will see some of the best musicians of the country. Any of the city newspapers provide pointers to the best shows.\n\nIf you're not such an anthropological type of tourist, you can check out the same papers for tips on other kinds of music. Being a big city, Rio has big and small clubs that play almost every kind of music. The major mainstream clubs mostly play whatever's on the Radio - which is usually whatever's on the USA radios and MTV - but the underground scene has a lot to offer on Rock, EDM, Rap and such. The best way to find out about those are the flyers handed or left at hostels, cinema and theater lobbies, nightclub lines, etc.\n\nNew Year's Eve celebrations\n\nRio hosts the country's largest and most popular New Year's Eve celebrations. The huge fireworks display and music shows attract 2 million people to the sands of Copacabana beach every year. People dress in white for luck and toast the arrival of the new year. It's usual also to have some national and international concerts on the beach for free.\n\nGay Travel\n\nRio de Janeiro is the main destination for lesbian and gay travellers from all over Brazil and the rest of the world. The city has been chosen as the best lesbian and gay international destination in 2009, and the sexiest gay place in the world in 2010 and 2011.\n\nHang gliding and paragliding\n\nThe Hangliding and Paragliding flights have found in Rio de Janeiro, the ideal land for its high hills and favorable wind. Different from other places in the world, in Rio, the sport could be done in urban areas and landing on the beach!\nThese conditions naturally attract many tourists who get the courage to enjoy a flight. And even the most inexperienced person can flight since there's no training or special gear needed.\n\nHiking and Trekking\n\nNot surprisingly, a huge city that has an actual forest within its limits has lots to offer for hikers. It's always advisable to have a local with you when trekking in Rio (Couchsurfing's Rio de Janeiro group usually organizes hikes around the city), as some treks are not very well-marked. Since the early 2000s there hasn't been any reports of violence/burglary on the city's trails (a problem in the 90s), but the rules on the Stay safe section apply as anywhere else in the city. Some of Rio's hiking trails include:\n\n Parque Lage - Corcovado\nThe trek is fairly demanding and steep, and takes about 1h30/2h to complete, but yet very popular among locals - it's normal to see whole families doing it, as well as groups of friends and foreigners. Buy the \"Metrô + Metrô Na Superfície\" ticket and go to Botafogo. From there, take the metrô bus to the station Hospital da Lagoa, which is close to the Parque Lage. Ask the park's staff or look for signs that say \"Trilha\" to get to the start of the trail, just behind the ruins of an old house. From there you have two paths: going straight ahead leads to a waterfall that is usually full of families on the weekends (it's a good spot to stop on your way back if you go back the same way), and left leads straight to the main path of the trek. Along the way there are 3 waterfalls (just one you can actually bath in, though) and a small path where you have to hang on to a chain to pass through some rocks. Until this point you will be going up, but always surrounded by forest. The first views of the city will start after the chain (about 1h/1h30 in). Then you get to the train tracks, either follow the rail tracks or the road up to the Christ (another 15 minutes). Views from here on are breathtaking. To go back down, you can get a van or walk about half a mile down to the parking place.\n\n Sugarloaf\nThis is a short and fairly easy hike, taking about 20/30' to complete, also very popular among locals, specially because you can go up for free then hitch a ride back on the cable car (after 7PM, it's free to return on it). The hike begins at Pista Cláudio Coutinho in Urca, and is very popular among the locals. If you ask the guards they'll point you to the start. It's uphill, but just the first five minutes are really steep and will need you to use your hands. From there on just keep to your left. There are amazing views of Urca and the Guanabara Bay during the final 20 minutes, some of which are angles you don't get from the vantage points above. The trek actually ends on top of Morro da Urca, the smallest of the two.\n\nPanoramic flights\nIf you have the money the following operators give you panoramic flights in helicopters:\n Riocopter - Helicopter Tour in Rio de Janeiro\n Helipoint.Rio - Helicopter Tour in Rio de Janeiro\n\nFavela (Shantytown) tours\nA number of operators offer tours of Rocinha, the largest and safest Favela in Rio. Many tours are done by outside companies in safari-like buses, which can lead to awkward interactions with the locals. Try to go with someone who lives in Rocinha on a walking tour. It is also possible to arrange tours to other favelas, although Rocinha has a longer history of tourism and is one of the more developed favelas.\n\nYou may hear stories about people being invited by locals to visit their home in a favela. If you receive such an invitation do think carefully about it and perhaps ask around about the person that has invited you. Many of the favelas are rife with drugs and guns so think carefully about how much you trust the person that is inviting you. A search on the Internet may reveal some accounts of tours others have taken. A visit like this will obviously be more authentic than a book tour and could be the highlight of your visit to Rio; on the other hand you are taking a risk. Also consider that favelas are normal neighbourhoods in Rio and not a zoo.\n\n Out of town trips \nPraia do Abricó – 50 km in the west. The best public naturist beach around Rio, located in Grumari, right after Prainha. Facilities and telephone service are quite limited, so plan ahead.\nPaquetá - Though not exactly outside of Rio, because it is an island and can only be reached by a 70 minutes ferry ride, this district of Rio makes an excellent (and inexpensive) day trip. The island is a car-free zone, so travel is limited to bicycles and electric golf carts. There's not a lot to do on this island, but the ferry ride is worth it."

        "do": " Do \nKarachi offers a wide scope of activities; however, don't expect too much even though it's one of the world's biggest cities. Due to being on the shoreline, Karachi offers plenty of opportunities for water babies.\n\n \n\nthumb|Boat harbour in Kiamari\n Boating You can hire a boat for a 15–20min ride at Kiamari boating harbour, which will take you to Manora Island (though not really an island) or tour you around the Karachi harbour. At the southeastern end of Manora island is the tallest lighthouse (28 m high) in Pakistan, which was erected by the British after they captured Karachi's Talpur rulers. The access to lighthouse is unfortunately restricted due to its presence inside the military protected area. Private boats can be hired for around Rs 500-3,000 per hour according to size of boat. If you are also interested in eating fish or crabs, ask the boat owner to arrange some and have a cookout on the boat while you travel. Please avoid taking photographs as it is prohibited when you're touring near the harbour due to its proximity to a Naval base, and other sensitive installations around. Even the boats crew will discourage you to take photos. Aside from the wooden trawlers, ferries are also available. Some captains of boats and ferry offers sea fishing, or even just crabbing but within the harbour. You can spend a romantic evening crabbing in Karachi's coastline beginning at sunset and ending with a delightful crab and seafood feast under the stars in evening. There are also two ferry boats run by government, which run twice daily and can take you to Manora island free of charges. You can also rent larger boats from Kiamari boat harbour for longer duration to go further away to other islands such as Bundle Island or Buddo Island but you'll have to heavily negotiate to get a better rate, and try to avoid the touts who would be lurking outside in the parking area. One of the best ways to see Karachi coastline is from the waters of Karachi. Boats in Kiamari may offer marvellous tour and views of the Karachi beach and Port of Karachi of varying durations and prices.\n \n \n Hutting - there are hundred of beach huts on the outskirts of the city, not found elsewhere in the country, built on the shoreline of the Arabian Sea. You can rent a hut on a daily, weekly or even monthly basis. When summer comes to Karachi, more beach huts spring up and every day large numbers of people from Karachi rent huts to enjoy picnic, swimming, and sunbathing. The huts are built on various small beaches located next to each other with a parallel access road and are less strict about clothing because of the more private access to the beach via these huts. Prices depend on the quality of hut you want, but normally start from Rs 8,000 a day. Prices can be negotiable though, so don't hesitate to haggle. Even huts with low charges are equipped with some basic furniture such as chairs and a bed together with a stove. Lifeguards and security are usually available as well in case of emergency. Bring your own food and drink. The beach with the most huts is , which is most popular due to its close proximity to the city. It's a sandy beach with crystal blue water and is one of the few beaches in the world where green sea turtles come to lay eggs. There are hundred of huts built on the beach shoreline along Hawke's Bay Drive.  is also a popular tourist spot due to its close proximity to the city. Huts built on the beach shoreline are along Manora Drive.  is often cited as Karachi’s most beautiful beach. Located half way between Hawke's Bay and Paradise Point, it offers plenty of beach huts for rent. Its rocky beach and clear water are ideal for fishing, snorkelling and scuba diving as well as surfing during the monsoon season. Visitors have to bring their own equipment for diving and fishing though. A minute away from French Beach is  and \"Turtle beach\" which have a mixture of small hills with a perfect sandy beach with a few beach huts. You'll need to book the hut in advance.\n \n \n \n Snorkelling and scuba diving Snorkelling and diving is getting popular in Karachi. The most well-known dive site in Karachi is Churna Island, where you can explore the city's beautiful aquatic life at a totally different level. It would be a thrilling, fun and excitement filled experience for those who've never dived before. The diving season in Karachi is from September to mid-May, so it's better not to dive during the monsoons in Pakistan which usually occur from June until September. The water temperature is a minimum of 16⁰C to a maximum of 29⁰C and you may dive to a depth of more than 30 m (100 ft). Churna Island is actually a small island off the coast of the city and is only accessible by boat. It has abundant of coral reefs and widely varied marine life which makes it very popular for diving. There is a marine park where you can find fishes such as hound fish, marlin, angel fish, parrot fish, puffer fish and barracuda together with dolphins, sea urchins, turtles, jelly fish and sea anemones as well. Karachi Scuba Diving Centre offer a complete scuba diving and snorkelling package which usually includes breakfast, lunch, diving instructions, diving gear, life jackets, local boat ride to Island and a pick-up, drop-off service as well Divers Reef Karachi along with knee-boarding, banana tubing and cliff diving. For those looking for some thrilling experience, take a thrilling and exciting ride on Jet Ski at the city's seashore. The riding time is from dawn in the morning until afternoon. Ride usually cost around Rs 3,000 for two persons.\nWater parks There are some water parks in Karachi located in the suburbs of the city. They usually charge around Rs 500 entrance ticket and open from early in the morning until 6PM. Among the good ones are  located on M-9, one of the best water park in Pakistan. Surely a family park so only families are allowed. Offering many exciting water slides including one of the most heart wrenching \"Raft Spiral Black Tunnel\", Teenager, Cyclone, Wave Pool, Lazy River, Mountain Fall, Aqua Play, Mini Titanic Ship, Light House, and Free Fall. The most amazing slide is Rainbow slide and  on N-5 which is recommended for ladies because it is one of the water parks in Karachi that offers private ladies slides in a wide range. Other includes Al Mehran Water Park and Dreams-world Resorts.\n Cricket at \n\nKarachi is home to some of Pakistan's important cultural institutions. The National Academy of Performing Arts, located in the newly renovated Hindu Gymkhana offers a two-year diploma course in performing arts that includes classical music and contemporary theatre. The All Pakistan Music Conference, linked to the 45-year old similar institution in Lahore, has been holding its Annual Music Festival since its inception in 2004. The Festival is now a well-established feature of the city life of Karachi that is eagerly awaited and attended by more than 3,000 citizens of Karachi as well as people from other cities.\n\nThe National Arts Council (Koocha-e-Saqafat) also has musical performances and Mushaira (poetry recitations). Karachi has a few museums including the Mohatta Palace Museum and National Museum of Pakistan that regularly have exhibitions related to performance arts. Karachi is also home to the annual Kara Film Festival, which is one of the biggest film festivals in Pakistan and showcases independent Pakistani and international films and documentaries.\n\nKarachi hosts plenty of cultural events on regular basis, from art exhibitions to concerts, theatre plays and local newspapers often have listings of forthcoming culture event in the city. The city has a fine collection of Anglo-Indian architecture, a legacy of the British Raj, which will keep history buffs engaged. Culture vultures will find a city with many art galleries, displaying a broad spectrum of works from Asia, and some New Age works from aspiring Pakistani artists. It is not wrong to mention that some of the most famous art galleries in Pakistan are found here.\n "

    "Hong Kong": {
        "do": "Do\n\nPop culture\nHong Kong was one of the main centres of Chinese pop culture from the communist revolution in 1949 until the 2010s, having given rise to many famous singers and actors. Hong Kong action cinema is legendary among Chinese people around the world. The city also played a key role in popularizing the genre of Cantopop, and some Cantopop songs have achieved cult status across the Chinese-speaking world, even among people who do not speak Cantonese. Television dramas by local station TVB also enjoyed loyal following among ethnic Chinese around the world.\n\nSince the 2010s, most of Hong Kong's top singers and actors have relocated to mainland China where they can make a lot more money. Nevertheless, the city continues to produce notable films on a regular basis, and Cantopop has experienced a revival of sorts in the 2020s, led by a new generation of local talent.\n\nMusic festivals\nClockenflap is Hong Kong's largest music festival, and includes popular artists, mainly from Europe and the US. It takes place in November on the Central Harbourfront Event Space.\n\nIndie events\nCantopop is by far the most popular genre in Hong Kong and receives an immense amount of support from the media. Independent musicians and are often harassed and evicted from their rehearsal rooms and concert venues by the government because they are forced to illegally rent warehouse spaces due to unaffordable rents. A few small venues are open for indie shows, such as Hidden Agenda and The Wanch.\n\nBeaches\nYou are never far from the sea in Hong Kong and going to a good beach is only a bus-ride away. However, if you want a really good beach, then it is worth making the effort to travel, possibly on foot, and seek out the beaches of the New Territories. With more than 200 outlying islands, as well as an extensive coastline that is jam-packed with impressive bays and beaches, you will surely come across some good looking beaches to while the whole day away. Hong Kong's urban beaches are usually well maintained and have services such as showers and changing rooms. Where beaches are managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, shark nets and life guards are present. Dogs and smoking are not permitted on these beaches.\n\nThe best beaches to use include:\n\nRepulse Bay is a large urban beach on the south side of Hong Kong island that features a colourful Chinese temple. Money has been spent on its facilities and will appeal to those who have young children.\n\nMiddle Bay is popular with gay people and is a 20-minute walk from the crowds at Repulse Bay. Middle Bay has lifeguards, showers, changing rooms, shark nets and a decent cafe serving drinks and snacks.\n\nShek O is a beach popular with many young locals. It is away from the bustle of the city but is well served by restaurants and has a good bus service from the north side of the island. The Thai restaurant close to the beach is worth a try.\n\nBig Wave Bay is smaller than other beaches on Hong Kong Island,  but has good services which include a number of small cafes close to the beach. Big Wave Bay has the sort of waves that appeal to surfers. From here it is possible to take the coastal footpath to Chai Wan where you can find the MTR and buses. The walk to Chai Wan is about one hour, or more if you are not used to the steep climb up the mountain.\n\nHung Shing Yeh Beach on Lamma Island is the most popular beach. This beach is Grade 1 and shows off powdery, fine sand and clear water. This beach has changing facilities, a barbecue area, and a refreshment kiosk. Take the ferryboat from Central Pier to Yung Shue Wan; expect to walk around 20 minutes from the ferry terminal to the beach (buses and taxis are not an option on Lamma).\n\nSwimming pools\nIn addition to pools in many hotels, there are several public swimming pools scattered across the territory. Entrance costs $19 on weekends/$17 on weekdays for adults and $9 on weekends/$8 on weekdays for children, usually only payable by Octopus Card or by coins. Swimming pools are child-friendly with shallow pools and fountains. All swimming pool complexes are well maintained and offer swimming lanes, hot showers, lockers ($5 coin deposit or your own lock required), both family and same-sex changing rooms (limited privacy), and most have swimming clubs for serious swimmers. Swimmers are expected to provide their own towels and toiletries. The Kowloon Park Swimming Pool Complex in Tsim Sha Tsui is centrally located and offers visitors a wide range of services and includes an indoor Olympic-sized pool.\n\nMost pools open at 6:30AM and close at 10PM. They generally close for lunch noon-1PM and then again from 5-6PM.\n\nSailing\nYou can rent a Junk Boat for a sailing trip. A typical junk boat can accommodate more than 30 people and can be rented for the day to take you on a tour of your choice. Sai Kung is a popular spot for the trip to start and you can sail to nearby beaches for a more secluded time. A cheaper alternative is to hire a much smaller water taxi (水道) to take you to where you want to go.\n\nThere are a few boats that operate \"sunset cruises\" on the harbour.\n\nSports\nThe sports landscape in Hong Kong generally reflects its legacy of British colonial rule. Hong Kong sends its own team to international sports competitions, separate from the Chinese team. Hong Kong also sends a team to China's National Games. It will host the fencing, track cycling, golf, rugby sevens, beach volleyball, triathlon, tenpin bowling, men's handball and men's U22 basketball events for the 2025 National Games, to be held on 9-21 November.\n\nThe most popular sport in Hong Kong is football (soccer), and while the local league and national team are not of a high standard, it has the highest participation rate among all team sports in Hong Kong. The main home stadium of the Hong Kong national team is the Hong Kong Stadium in Causeway Bay, but some home games may be played at the Mong Kok Stadium instead.\n\nRugby union is also popular, with the territory hosting the Hong Kong Sevens, the world's most prestigious rugby sevens tournament, every year at Hong Kong Stadium. Hong Kong also has a respectable rugby union national team, which is the second strongest in Asia after Japan.\n\nCricket is most popular among the South Asian and Eurasian (European and Asian mixed-race) communities, and membership in the Hong Kong Cricket Club or Kowloon Cricket Club is somewhat of a status symbol for Hongkongers. Due to Hong Kong's mild climate, cricket is generally played in the winter months (Sept-April). Hong Kong is a third-tier ICC team, occasionally entering qualifying rounds for major tournaments but not routinely facing the stronger nations. The Hong Kong national cricket team plays at Tin Kwong Road (formerly Mission Road) in Kowloon.\n\nThe Kau Sai Chau Public Golf Course, on the eponymous island, is Hong Kong's only public golf course.\n\nHiking and camping\nthumb|300px|Pui O beach is a great destination for campers at Sai Kung East Country Park\n\nHiking is the best kept secret in Hong Kong, it is a great way to appreciate Hong Kong's beautiful landscapes that include mountains, beaches and breathtaking cityscapes. The starting points for many hiking trails are accessible by bus or taxi. \n\nHiking in Hong Kong can be strenuous because of the steep trails, and during the summer months, mosquitos and the hot, humid, weather combine to make even the easiest trek a workout. Wear suitable clothes, and bring plenty of water and mosquito repellent. It is fairly unlikely that you will have a close encounter with venomous snakes, although they are present in most rural areas. Most local people choose the winter months to undertake the more demanding hiking trails. If you are not especially fit you might plan your route so that you take a bus or taxi to the highest point of the trail and then walk downhill.\n\nCampsites in Hong Kong are plentiful and free of charge. Most are in country parks and range from basic sites serviced with only with a pit toilet, to those that provide campers with modern toilet blocks and cold showers. Some sites have running water and sinks for washing dishes. A few campsites have places to buy drinking water and food. Whilst many are serenely remote, weekends and public holidays are predictably busy, especially in the more accessible places close to roads. Hongkongers who camp like to do so in large groups, talk loudly, and stay awake late into the night. If you are noise sensitive try to find a remote campsite or pack some good earplugs.\n\nThere are four major trails in Hong Kong:\n Lantau Trail on Lantau.\n Hong Kong Trail on Hong Kong Island.\n Maclehose Trail through the New Territories. \n Wilson Trail starting on Hong Kong Island and finishing in the New Territories.\n\nHong Kong has some exceptional rural landscapes but visitor impact is an issue. Respect the countryside by taking your litter home with you. Avoid putting food in litter bins in remote areas as these are not emptied on a regular basis and your trash may be strewn around by hungry animals.\n\nHong Kong Outdoors is packed with information on hiking and camping, and other great things to do and places to go in the wilderness areas of Hong Kong.\n\nGambling\nWhile the closest casinos are in Macau, other forms of gambling are legal and regulated in Hong Kong:\n\n Horse racing is the most popular and is further detailed above.\n Football betting is legal only at branches of the Hong Kong Jockey Club. Betting on other sports is prohibited.\n Lottery is also legal only at branches of the Hong Kong Jockey Club. Marksix is a popular game costing $10 per bet. You pick 6 of 49 numbers, and the lottery result will be announced on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and weekends that don't have horse racing scheduled.\n Mahjong (麻雀 màh-jeuk) also forms an integral part of Hong Kong gambling culture, although it is often informal and difficult for foreigners to get involved with. Mahjong has a strong influence on Hong Kong pop culture, with a history of songs, films and television series based on a mahjong theme. The game played in Hong Kong is the Cantonese version, which differs in rules and scoring from the Japanese version, Taiwanese version or the versions played in other parts of China. Mahjong parlours are plentiful, although hard to find. They also have many unwritten rules that visitors may find hard to understand."

        "do": "Do\n\n Beaches \nthumb|Bondi Beach\nSydney's beaches are the perfect place to spend a warm summer day, where you can swim or lie on the sands to your heart's content. The most popular are Bondi, Manly, Cronulla and Coogee, although many others have their own charms. They might not be miles of golden beaches like Queensland, but there's a great variety, ranging from ocean beaches nestled between towering headlands in the Eastern Suburbs to quiet bays facing the harbour in Mosman. Bondi and Coogee are backpacker haunts while Manly and Cronulla feel like separate seaside towns. Soak in the crowded atmosphere amongst the other sunseekers in the eastern beaches, or be one of the few enjoying the solitude in the Northern Beaches and the Royal National Park. Brave the ocean waves, or splash about in the shallower rock pools. Even in winter, you can join the hardy souls keeping to their exercise regime in the cold waters.\n\nSurf at one of Sydney's many surf beaches, a quintessentially Australian experience. The major beaches (Bondi, Manly, Cronulla) have surf schools and places where you can rent surfboards. Locals have their own secret favourites in the Northern Beaches and Maroubra, and can be fiercely territorial.\n\n Kayak and canoe \n\nSydney's waterways offer great canoeing and kayaking, and you can explore Sydney's bushland, history, and exclusive waterfront properties. There are lots of places to hire them from, or to even go on a guided tour.\n\n The Spit or Manly to kayak the harbour.\n Lane Cove National Park and the Royal National Park have canoes and kayaks by the hour - see turtles and birdlife as you paddle\n You can paddle on the Georges River from Woronora, or the Port Hacking river from Bundeena.\n You can hire canoes at Rose Bay, a little bit east of the city.\n You can also hire a canoe and have a BBQ at Lake Parramatta; 15-30 minutes by car from Parramatta.\n\n Fish \n\nSydney offers decent fishing although it is not recommended to fish in Sydney Harbour to the west of the Harbour Bridge due to pollution and the fish are tainted with dioxin which is harmful to humans. You will nevertheless see local residents fishing on the harbour.\nYou can sign up with a fishing charter to take you out of the Harbour into open water, Middle Harbour or Pittwater is a rewarding experience. You'll likely catch something of decent size and even if you don't, being out on a boat in Sydney is one of the great Sydney experiences in the warmer months.\n\nWalk\nthumb|Walk through the Royal Botanic Gardens\nthumb|right|Talk a stroll through The Domain\nSydney has a huge amount of green space, much of it beside the sparkling harbour or ocean, so walking is a great way to experience the city's parks, reserves and remnant bushland. There are also great walks through the more built-up areas, allowing you to check out the city's modern architecture and its colonial heritage. The following are just a few of the better-known routes.\n\n Circular Quay and surrounds. Start underneath the Sydney Harbour Bridge, then walk with the harbour waters on your left, down through The Rocks, across Circular Quay, up to and around the Sydney Opera House, down through the Royal Botanic Gardens, and up to the magnificent view of the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge at Mrs Macquarie's Chair. Some variation of this spectacular walk is, for many, the epitome of the Sydney experience. For detailed information about a walking tour of the city centre, covering these sights (in the opposite direction) and other major sights, see Walking tour of Sydney.\n Across the Harbour Bridge from The Rocks on the south side to Milsons Point on the north side (or vice versa).\n Coogee Beach to Bondi. Following the eastern coastline past several of Sydney's beautiful beaches - stop off for a swim if you get too hot.\n \n \n\nFor quieter trails with a rural feel, the best choices would either be Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park or Garigal National Park, both which are not too far away from Sydney CBD.\n\n Sports fixtures \n\nRugby/Footy in Winter\nThe winter rugby football season generally begins with trial matches in February, before the season proper kicks off in March and runs to late September or early October. Sydney's most popular football code is rugby league (often just called 'football' or 'footy' by locals — although never just 'rugby', which refers to rugby union). Nine teams from the national competition are based in Sydney and the sport is an important part of the city's culture - many teams play at least some of their games at intimate grounds in their suburban heartlands, and this can be a good way to experience the traditional heart of the sport.\n\nCricket in Summer\nSydney's primary summer sport is cricket, which you'll find being played (in somewhat modified form) on beaches and in backyards across the city. The professional stuff is largely based at the Sydney Cricket Ground close to the CBD: the traditional New Year's Test, between the Australian team and whichever foreign team is touring at the time, commences around the 3rd of January and runs for four to five days. Later in the summer, international one-day and/or Twenty20 matches are held at the SCG. The primary domestic tournaments, contested between Australian state teams, are the Sheffield Shield (first-class), Ford Ranger Cup (one-day) and KFC Big Bash (Twenty20): they are usually sparsely attended and so are much cheaper to attend than internationals. Some one-day and Twenty20 matches are played at ANZ Stadium at Olympic Park rather than at the SCG, but the cavernous stadium is far inferior to the grand old ground if you really want to get a feel for cricket culture.\n\n Bike and skate \nthumb|right|Bondi skate park\nCycle around Centennial Park in the Eastern Suburbs or Bicentennial Park at Sydney Olympic Park. Or mountain bike on the challenging hills around the parks, forests and waterways surrounding Sydney and through some spectacular countryside.\n\nSydney has many skate parks and bowls in its suburbs, and one of the most popular is the one next to Bondi Beach. Sydney has ice skating centres, with the Macquarie Ice Rink in the Macquarie Park-Ryde area. Canterbury Olympic Icerink is closed and being renovated (Feb 2024).\n\nPerforming arts\nStage\n\nthumb|right|Capitol Theatre\nSydney has three major commercial theatres which show the big international musical productions, the Capitol Theatre in Haymarket, the Theatre Royal under the MLC Centre in the CBD and the Lyric Theatre in The Star casino complex at Pyrmont Bay.\n\nThe Sydney Theatre Company (artistically directed until 2013 by Cate Blanchett and now by her husband Andrew Upton) is the biggest professional theatre company in the city. It produces a large annual program using The Sydney Theatre and the two Wharf Theatres in Walsh Bay in The Rocks and sometimes the Sydney Opera House Drama Theatre as well.\n\nThe Belvoir St Theatre in Surry Hills in City East has long been the smaller cousin to the Sydney Theatre Company, a place where young actors and directors cut their teeth in the associated Company B troupe before going on to bigger things. It stages a number of plays every year and you can wander the foyer before the show and see how many Hollywood names you can pick out from the old production posters.\n\nThe Ensemble Theatre at Kirribilli in the Lower North Shore (just over the Harbour Bridge) is Sydney's oldest surviving professional company and also produces a full program of plays every year, often featuring Australia's locally famous thespians.\n\nThere are also a number of small drama theatres with companies in Sydney including the New Theatre in Newtown in the Inner West, the Griffin Theatre Company at the SBW Stables Theatre in Kings Cross in City East and the Darlinghurst Theatre in Potts Point in City East.\n\nThe Seymour Centre (part of Sydney University just off Broadway on City Road) is a complex of several medium sized theatres hired by many independent and touring productions through the year. It is also the home of the University Revues, usually around August to September, a series of comedy sketch and musical shows put on by the students of each faculty in the University. Sometimes a place to spot future talent, famous past writers and performers in the reviews have included Clive James and Germaine Greer.\n\nAmateur theatre, especially musical theatre, proliferates in Sydney, with over 30 amateur musical theatre companies providing a fun night of theatre for around $20 per ticket out in the suburbs. Check the Riverside Theatre in Parramatta, the Zenith Theatre in Chatswood on the Lower North Shore, the Sutherland Entertainment Centre in Sutherland and the Glen Street Theatre in Belrose in the Northern Beaches. Most of these theatres also feature occasional travelling professional productions.\n\nClassical Music\nFor classical music fans, the Sydney Symphony Orchestra produces a large annual season and plays primarily at the Sydney Opera House Concert Hall but sometimes also at the Angel Place Recital Hall.\n\nThe Australian Chamber Orchestra also produces a large annual program, mostly at the Angel Place Recital Hall but sometimes also at the Sydney Opera House.\n\nThe Sydney Conservatorium of Music in Macquarie Street often hosts performances on a smaller scale in the Verbruggen Hall within the conservatorium.\n\nIf you're in Sydney in the summer month of January look out for the major outdoor concerts held by both the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and Opera Australia in The Domain as part of the annual Sydney Festival. These free concerts are often attended by over 60,000 people.\n\nOpera\nOpera Australia, the national Opera company based in Sydney, performs an annual season at the Sydney Opera House in the City Centre.\n\nBallet\nThe Australian Ballet is the Australian national ballet company. Although based in Melbourne it splits its annual season between that city and the Sydney Opera House.\n\nJazz\nThe Basement nightclub near Circular Quay is Sydney's oldest and most pre-eminent jazz venue. It features other styles of music as well but has a reputation as the place all the big jazz acts perform when they're in town.\n\nThe Sydney Improvised Music Association (SIMA) features regular jazz in The Sound Lounge venue within the Seymour Centre (part of Sydney University just off Broadway on City Road). Venue 505 in Surry Hills features live jazz 6 nights a week and Foundry616 in Ultimo is another dedicated venue. Many of the small bars across the inner Sydney feature small jazz performances on any given night.\n\nGig Guide\nThe major guide for performing arts in Sydney is the Spectrum liftout, which you'll find in the Sydney Morning Herald's voluminous Saturday edition. It contains reviews and features on all things cultural as well as comprehensive listings towards the back.\n\nSydney Music provides an online gig-guide which is updated weekly and provides comprehensive listings of shows at smaller venues around the city. \n\nCinema\n\nSydney has mainstream movies showing on multi-screen cinema complexes all around Sydney, including the City Centre and Moore Park. The two main operators are Event Cinemas and Hoyts. For arthouse, or more obscure movies, try the Chauvel, Verona and Academy Twin cinemas on Oxford Street in the City East, or the Dendy near the Opera House in the City Centre or in Newtown, or Cinema Paris at the Entertainment Quarter at Fox Studios at Moore Park in the City East. Many of the larger cinema complexes offer premium seating and services for a premium price.\n\nFor a different experience, look out for open-air cinemas in the Royal Botanical Gardens or Centennial Park. There is one drive-in movie left open in Sydney, at Blacktown in the Outer West.\n\nThe IMAX Theatre, which provides a movie experience with the largest cinema screens in the southern hemisphere in Darling Harbour.\n\n Drag shows \nAs one of the biggest and most famous gay capitals of the world, Sydney is the place to catch a drag show. If you’ve never experienced the glitz and glitter of professional drag acts, then you really shouldn’t leave town without heading to one of the top drag clubs in the city.\n\nIn Darlinghurst, drag queens like Polly’s Follies in the Stonewall Hotel or the spectacular Disgraceland in Nevermind are some of the best acts in town and you’ll marvel at the costume changes and the sheer amount of make up. However, make up aside, the transformation from men into women is incredible and these ladies sure know how to entertain. Drag shows are popular with hen nights and birthday parties, but really they’re great fun for anyone who wants a night of pure unadulterated entertainment. Some drag acts are part of cabaret clubs, so there's a wide variety of acts throughout the evening. Other clubs are solely dedicated to drag performances and it’s a whirlwind of costume changes, make-up and incredible dance moves.\n\nFestivals\n\nSydney is home to a number of major and minor festivals and calendar events each year. Listed chronologically these are:\n\nJanuary\n \n\n \n\nFebruary\n \n\nMarch\n \n \n \n\nApril\n \n \nthumb|The lights of Vivid Sydney\n\nMay\n \n \n\nJune\n \n\nJuly\n \n \n\nSeptember\n \n \n \n\nOctober\n \n \n\nNovember\n \n\nDecember\n\n \n \nthumb|Happy New Year's festival in Sydney "

Their home stadiums can be found in the Northern Suburbs. They are widely regarded as among the best football teams in the world; catching a game is a must. Other teams include Rayo Vallecano, in the neighbourhood of Vallecas or Getafe in the nearby suburbs, which are served by Madrid Metro.\n\nThere are also major basketball teams: Estudiantes, Real Madrid, and Fuenlabrada. The first two play at the Palacio de los Deportes every other weekend during the season. Fuenlabrada, based in the Madrid suburb of the same name, play at Polideportivo Fernando Martín.\n\nHandball is also played in Madrid but the big sports conglomerates of Madrid are no longer involved in the top leagues making BM Alcobendas the highest ranked Handball team from the greater Madrid area.\n\n Cultural venues \nthumb|Teatro real, or the Royal Theatre\nFlamenco shows can be seen in numerous venues in Sol-Letras-Lavapiés, Moncloa and La Latina - Austrias.\n\nOpera houses are spread through the city centre. In addition, several orchestras don't have a stable/home venue to play in:\n \n \n \nthumb|Performance of the Banda Sinfónica Municipal in El Retiro Park\n\nthumb|right|Cine Ideal offers subtitled movies in English\nCinemas offer films in English, along with films in other languages. These original films are denoted in the listings by a designation of \"V.O.\" which stands for versión original. Cinemas in Madrid will sometimes have días del espectador (viewer days) with cheaper ticket prices, usually on Mondays or Wednesdays. It also has the world's largest multiplex cinema,  with 25 different screens.\n\n Festivals \nthumb|Madrid Gay Pride 2008"

    "Rome": {
        "do": "Do\nTake in a show. There are lots of theatres, but you will need to know Italian to enjoy them. The main concert venue is the Auditorium in Viale Pietro de Coubertin to the north of Rome. The Auditorium at Parco della Musica is a large complex composed of three separate halls whose shapes are inspired by musical instruments. These are positioned around an open-air amphitheatre, that is used nearly every night in the summer for concerts. The Parco della Musica hosts a constant stream of classical, popular, and jazz music, featuring national as well as international musicians and groups. Really big names perform outdoors in the summer; usually in either the Olympic Stadium or in Stadio Flaminio, which is next door to the Parco della Musica. In winter the Palalotto in EUR is an important pop concert venue.\n To get full details of what is on, buy a copy of the La Repubblica newspaper on Thursdays, when it has an insert called TrovaRoma. There are a couple of pages in English but even with no Italian you should be able to decipher the main listings. This is not published in late July and August, when half of Rome heads to the beach. Both La Repubblica and Il Messaggero have daily listings.\n Walk and feel the energy of Rome; sights are everywhere waiting to be discovered.\n Walk or cycle along the banks of the Tiber. There are steps down to the river from close to most of the bridges. A few have special runners for cycle wheels. This gets you away from the traffic fumes and gives a different perspective of Rome. Not usually possible in winter when water levels can be very high.\n Explore the Trastevere neighbourhood for some great cafes and trattorie, and a glimpse at a hip Roman neighbourhood.\n Watch football ie soccer. The city has two teams playing in Serie A, the top tier of Italian football, AS Roma and SS Lazio. They share the Stadio Olimpico, capacity 70,000, in the north of the city. Matches between the two teams are known as the Derby della Capitale, and are extremely charged affairs, with crowd violence being a regular occurrence, sometimes even resulting in fatal stabbings.\n\nEvents\n \n \n \n "

    "Kuala Lumpur": {
        "do": "Do\n\nthumb|300px|Looking up at the Petronas Towers\nKuala Lumpur is well known for its wide range of shopping and eating options, which are adequately covered in the Eat and Buy sections of this article and listings within the district articles. Skyscraper Gazing is the obvious option, with glass and steel abound and excellent views available from the Petronas Towers or the KL Tower (Menara KL) viewing decks, both located in the Golden Triangle.\n\nArts & Culture\nLike much of Kuala Lumpur, there is an interesting mix of arts and culture to experience, ranging from traditional Malay to Islamic to  modern. Several good theatres and performance halls have emerged as part of Malaysia's drive to encourage greater cultural expression. These include the National Theatre (Istana Budaya) and the Kuala Lumpur Performing Arts Centre in the northern part of the city, the Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra (Dewan Filharmonik) in the Twin Towers, and the Actors Studio at Lot 10. Leading museums in the Old City Centre are the National Museum, which covers the region's history, and the well-regarded Islamic Arts Museum, which houses a small but captivating collection.\n\nPampering\nPampering and spas can be found in several five-star hotels and independent centres in the Golden Triangle. There's also nail parlours and beauty salons, which are generally good value, there's also high-end ones offering similar services for a premium. Reflexology and foot massage places are everywhere, especially in Bukit Bintang in the Golden Triangle and in Chinatown.\n\nFor those who are willing to be a bit more adventurous, try hunting down a fish foot spa and relax whilst fish nibble away at your feet. However do be careful which one you go to as some are of low standard and you may get an infection or even a blood borne disease. Try a fish spa in a tourist area as these tend to be better maintained.\n\nSports\nUrban sports such as golfing, cycling, running, jogging and horse riding are common in Kuala Lumpur. If you’re into rock climbing, the Batu Caves in the Northern suburbs is popular. However given Malaysia's stunning terrain, you’re better off heading to other places for anything more strenuous or challenging.\n\nYou can also watch the local football match at the KLFA Stadium in Cheras. Kuala Lumpur FA is a football team based in Kuala Lumpur and plays in the top division of football in Malaysia, the Malaysia Super League. Match schedule and fixture can be seen at the KLFA website.\n\nVolunteer\nVolunteering is not often the first thing you may considering doing when in Kuala Lumpur, however there are various projects to give your time and help out the community. Regardless of spending one day or even a week or more volunteering for a cause, you will probably find something that you are interested in. Below are some volunteering options available within Kuala Lumpur.\n\n \n \n "

    "Singapore": {
        "do": "Do\nWhile you can find a place to practice nearly any sport in Singapore — golfing, surfing, scuba diving, even ice skating and snow skiing — due to the country's small size your options are rather limited and prices are relatively high. For watersports in particular, the busy shipping lanes and sheer population pressure mean that the sea around Singapore is murky, and most locals head up to Pulau Tioman, Sibu Island (Malaysia) or Bintan (Indonesia) instead. On the upside, there is an abundance of dive shops in Singapore, and they often arrange weekend trips to good dive sites off the East Coast of Malaysia, so they are a good option for accessing some of Malaysia's not-so-touristy dive sites.\n\nCulture\nthumb|Esplanade Theatres by the Bay|315x315px\nOn the cultural side of things, Singapore has been trying to shake off its boring, buttoned-down reputation and attract more artists and performances. The star in Singapore's cultural sky is the Esplanade theatre in Marina Bay, a world-class facility for performing arts and a frequent stage for the Singapore Symphony Orchestra. Pop culture options are rapidly growing and Singapore's home-grown arts scene is undergoing a second renaissance, with local English-language acts like The Sam Willows and Gentle Bones joining local Chinese pop starlets Stefanie Sun and JJ Lin on the scene. Any bands and DJs touring Asia are also pretty much guaranteed to perform in Singapore.\n\nGoing to the movies is a popular Singaporean pastime, but look for \"M18\" (age 18 and above only) or \"R21\" ratings (age 21 and above only) if you like your movies with fewer cuts. The big four theatre chains are Cathay, Carnival Cinemas, Golden Village and Shaw Brothers. For a taste of Singapore through film, Jack Neo's popular comedies showcase the foibles of Singaporean life, while directors like K. Rajagopal, Boo Jun Feng, and Tan Pin Pin are ushering in a new wave of contemporary film art in Singapore.\n\nFor classical music, Singapore is home to the Singapore Symphony Orchestra, which is mainly based in the Esplanade concert hall, though it does hold free concerts in the Singapore Botanic Gardens every year. The T'ang Quartet is a highly acclaimed professional string quartet based in Singapore, and regularly puts on performances of chamber music. For traditional Chinese music, there is the Singapore Chinese Orchestra.\n\nAs for more contemporary music, Singapore has both attracted international events to expand here, as well as cultivated its own festivals. Ultra Singapore is the local edition of the renowned Ultra Music Festival since 2016, bringing in internationally renowned electronic music acts. Laneway Singapore is the local edition of the St Jerome's Laneway Festival running since 2011, though there has been a hiatus in 2019. Baybeats is a free annual music festival at the Esplanade since 2002, usually spanning over a weekend and focused on indie musicians, mostly from Singapore and nearby Asian countries. The Garden Beats Festival is a ticketed event touted as an \"electronic picnic festival\" in Fort Canning Park, bringing in international acts while promoting eco-friendly ideas as \"the first carbon-neutral music festival in Singapore\".\n\nJazz music lovers may also be interested in the Singapore International Jazz Festival (usually abbreviated as Sing Jazz), which so far has taken place roughly March–April of the year, and has featured jazz headliners alongside jazz-adjacent musicians.\n\nIn May or June, don't miss the yearly Singapore International Festival of Arts (formerly the Singapore Arts Festival), featuring a programme of art exhibitions/performances and artist conversations over several weeks. Following up from that, in August you can catch the annual Singapore Night Festival all along the Bras Basah. Bugis district, where numerous artistic/musical events - many of them free - take place at night over two weeks (but concentrated on weekends). A recurring headline event is the projection mapping light show, whereby animation is mapped and projected on the facade of the Singapore National Museum, creating a unique display.\n\nAdvance tickets for almost any cultural event can be purchased from SISTIC, either on-line or from any of their numerous ticketing outlets, including the Singapore Visitor Centre on Orchard Rd.\n\nWayang is a Chinese street opera, performed in open-air theaters by troupes. It combines a wide variety of traditional art forms with singing, mime, dancing, acrobatics and martial arts.\n\nGambling\nSingapore has two massive casinos, always referred to with the euphemism \"integrated resort\", which pull in nearly as much revenue as the entirety of Las Vegas. Marina Bay Sands at Marina Bay is the larger and swankier of the two, while Resorts World Sentosa at Sentosa aims for a more family-friendly experience. While locals (citizens and permanent residents) have to pay $100/day to get in, foreign visitors can enter for free after presenting their passport.\n\nBesides the casino, there are other forms of legalised betting which are more accessible to the locals. This includes horse racing, which is run by the Singapore Turf Club on weekends, as well as football (soccer) betting and several lotteries run by the Singapore Pools. Horse racing will be terminated on 5 October 2024 with the racecourse is to be demolished and redeveloped.\n\nMahjong is also a popular pastime in Singapore. The version played in Singapore is similar to the Cantonese version, but it also has extra \"animal tiles\" not present in the original Cantonese version, as well as several scoring differences. However, this remains pretty much a family and friends affair, and there are no (legal) mahjong parlours as the operation of gambling dens is illegal.\n\nGambling in public (e.g. playing poker or blackjack at a park) is illegal and punishable with fine and imprisonment under Singaporean law.\n\nGolf\nDespite its small size, Singapore has a surprisingly large number of golf courses, but most of the best ones are run by private clubs and open to members and their guests only. The main exceptions being the Sentosa Golf Club, the Sembawang Country Club and the Sime Course of Keppel Club, though they charge much higher fees than for members. See the Singapore Golf Association for the full list; alternatively, head to the nearby Indonesian islands of Batam or Bintan or across the Second Link to Iskandar Puteri, Malaysia.\n\n Races \nthumb|The Singapore Grand Prix takes place at the Marina Bay Street Circuit.\n Singapore Grand Prix is an on-street Formula One motor-race held in the streets of Marina Bay in Sept / Oct.\n Singapore Turf Club in Kranji hosts horse races most Fridays, including a number of international cups, and is popular with local gamblers.\n Singapore Polo Club near Balestier is also open to the public on competition days.\n\nSpas\nSingapore has experienced a 'spa boom', and there is now plenty of choice for everything from holistic Ayurveda to green tea hydrotherapy. However, prices aren't as rock-bottom as in neighbours Indonesia and Thailand, and you'll generally be looking at upwards of $50 even for a plain one-hour massage. Premium spas can be found in most 5 star hotels and on Orchard, and Sentosa's Spa Botanica also has a good reputation. There are also numerous shops offering traditional Chinese massage, which are mostly legitimate, although some sketchier \"health centres\" do remain. Traditional Asian-style public baths are non-existent.\n\nWhen looking for beauty salons on Orchard Road, try out the ones on the fourth floor of Lucky Plaza. They offer most salon services like manicures, pedicures, facials, waxing and hair services. A favourite of flight crews and repeat tourists due to the lower costs as compared to the sky high prices of other salons along the shopping belt. Shop around for prices, some of the better looking ones actually charge less.\n\nSwimming\nForget your tiny hotel pool if you are into competitive or recreational swimming: Singapore is paradise for swimmers with arguably the highest density of public pools in the world. They are all open-air 50 m pools (some facilities even feature up to three 50 m pools), accessible for an entrance fee of $1–1.50. Some of the visitors don't swim at all. They just come from nearby housing complexes for a few hours to chill out, read and relax in the sun. Most are open daily 8AM-9PM and all feature a small cafe. Just imagine swimming your lanes in the tropical night with lit up palm trees surrounding the pool.\n\nThe Singapore Sports Council maintains a list of pools, most of which are part of a larger sports complex with a gym, running track, tennis courts etc., and are near the MRT station they're named after. Perhaps the best is in Katong (111 Wilkinson Road, on the East Coast): after the swim, stroll through the villa neighbourhood directly in front of the pool entrance and have a look at the luxurious, original architecture of the houses that really rich Singaporeans live in. If you get bored with regular swimming pools, head to the Jurong East Swimming Complex where you get the wave pool, water slides and Jacuzzi at an insanely affordable entrance fee of $1.50 on weekdays and $2 on weekends. For those who feel richer, visit the Wild Wild Wet water theme park or the Adventure Cove Waterpark and get yourself wet with various exciting water slides and tidal wave pools.\n\nFor those who don't like pools, head out to the beaches. The East Coast Park has a scenic coastline that stretches over 15 km. It's a popular getaway spot for Singaporeans to swim, cycle, barbeque and engage in various other sports and recreational activities. Sentosa island also has three white, sandy beaches - Siloso Beach, Palawan Beach and Tanjong Beach - each with its own distinct characteristics, and also very popular with locals.\n\nWater sports\nCanoeing and dragon-boating are popular water-sports in Singapore, and there are many beautiful reservoirs and rivers where one can partake in such physical activity. Check out the MacRitchie Reservoir, Kallang River and Marina Bay for reasonably priced options. Besides these more regular water sports, Singapore also offers water sports fans trendy activities such as cable-Skiing and wave surfing in specially created environments.\n\nSnow sports\nBeing just one degree north of the equator, it is obviously not the best place on earth for skiing, but sunny Singapore still has a permanent indoor snow centre. Snow City offers visitors a chance to experience winter. Visitors can escape from the hot and humid tropical weather to play in snow or even learn to ski and snowboard with certified professional instructors.\n\nIce skating is also possible in Singapore, in Kallang Ice World at Leisure Park Kallang."

        "do": "Do\n\nOutdoors\n Toronto is \"the city within a park\", with miles and miles of parkland following the streams and rivers that flow through the city. Edwards Gardens and the Toronto Botanical Gardens in the neighbourhood of North York might just be the place to start exploring this natural environment.\n The City of Toronto has designated various Discovery Walks which highlight the natural and human history of the region.  These can be found with brown circular signs along the route and highlight other regions such as the Belt Line, Garrison Creek and the Humber River as well as the downtown core.\n Beaches. Toronto has three main sections of beach along Lake Ontario. The most popular of these is in the aptly-named Beaches neighbourhood. A less popular alternative is the beaches in the western end of the city in the Parkdale neighbourhood; this was once Toronto's Coney Island, with an amusement park and numerous beach-style attractions; however in the 1950s the city built the Gardiner Expressway along the lakeshore, effectively separating the beaches from the city and causing the demolition of the amusement park; over the years attempts have been made to re-energize this area, but the Gardiner remains a major barrier, as well as a source of noise and pollution to keep away would-be beach-goers. On the plus side, the beaches are largely empty most of the time, providing solitude for those who seek it. The third major beach area in the city runs along the south shore of the Toronto Islands. This area is pleasantly secluded, with most of the islands covered with parkland and a small amusement park. Hanlan's Point Beach on the western shore of the islands is the City of Toronto's only officially recognized clothing optional beach, and a popular gay hangout. Despite these options, many Torontonians prefer to leave the city for beach trips; the most popular beaches are those in the Georgian Bay area north of Toronto, Wasaga Beach in particular is very popular during the summer.\n\nArts & entertainment\n Comedy. World-renowned Second City comedy/improv theatre has a location in Toronto. See great improv and situation comedy performed live with audience participation over dinner and drinks in the heart of the club district of downtown Toronto.\n Theatre. Toronto has a great theatre scene for every taste and budget. Check out the big theatres on Yonge Street for the big splashy shows. Small theatres in the Annex and elsewhere offer smaller productions that range from original Canadian works, avant-garde, experimental theatre, small budget musicals to British murder mysteries. A variety of theatre festivals such as the New Ideas, Rhubarb and Fringe festivals are the seed for many commercial success such as The Drowsy Chaperone. Also try to check out the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts, the home of the Canadian Opera Company and the National Ballet of Canada. The Toronto Symphony plays in the acoustically renovated Roy Thomson Hall. TO Tix in Yonge-Dundas Square is the best place to get full-price advance and day-of discounts on shows across Toronto. It also offers theatre and dining packages, partnering Toronto’s theatre, dance and opera companies with local downtown restaurants and cultural attractions.\n\nAnnual events\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nExploring neighbourhoods\nthumbnail|Crowds along Chinatown, on Spadina.\nthumbnail|Pedestrian streets in Koreatown.\nToronto has so many eclectic neighbourhoods that a random walk is fascinating in its own right. You might start in the Downtown area and then try other neighbourhoods around the city. Here are a few suggestions of neighbourhoods to visit. More details and more examples are found in the district articles.\n Distillery District. The former Gooderham & Worts distillery lands have been rejuvenated into a pedestrian-only village dedicated to the arts and entertainment. It has fantastic restaurants, festivals, and art galleries housed in its 19th-century distillery buildings.\n Harbourfront, Toronto's former industrial port, is today largely parkland with biking and walking trails and excellent views of the harbour. Harbourfront Centre is situated right by the lake, and is home to numerous cultural events of which most are free or relatively inexpensive. Take in some of the worlds most critically acclaimed performing arts productions, or enjoy one of the many world festivals that take place every weekend.\n Toronto Islands. A short inexpensive ferry ride from the foot of Bay Street and you leave the bustle of the city behind. Visually, the views of the skyline from the islands are stunning, and for cycling, walking, picnics or just relaxing, the Toronto Islands are hard to beat. There is even a small amusement park for kids, Centreville. On hot summer days, temperatures here will often be about 2-3C lower than the mainland providing relief. By mid-summer the water is warm enough to swim at Hanlan's Point or for the more adventurous, a nude beach is nearby.\n Little Italy  is the spot to get a sense of the Western Mediterranean. Sit at one of the many coffee shops and watch the world go by on the weekends. A great time to visit is during the men's FIFA World Cup competition (in football/soccer), regardless of where in the world it is actually being held as local communities face off and rivalries reach a fever pitch. Support can be passionate and even in adjacent communities and it is not unusual to see them draped in a mind-numbing variety of flags once every four years.\n Toronto's Chinatown is a great way to sample a tiny bit of cities like Hong Kong, without spending the airfare. Vast crowds crush the sidewalks as vendors sell authentic Chinese and Vietnamese food, and not-so-authentic knock-offs. It is one of North America's largest Chinatowns, and with many shops aimed at tourists, it is a good place to pick up some unusual and inexpensive souvenirs. The area is also home to a growing number of Korean and Vietnamese shops and restaurants. Toronto's multicultural mosaic never stops evolving. For a complete tour, travel along Spadina (north/south) starting at College Street in the north or Queen Street in the south. However, those looking for good, authentic Chinese food may be disappointed, and most of the restaurants here are tourist traps; these days the best Chinese food can be found in the suburbs of Markham and Richmond Hill.\n Kensington Market was once a centre of Jewish life that has morphed into the centre of Toronto's bohemian scene. Visitors will be assaulted by sounds and smells unlike anywhere else in the city, as narrow streets bustle with immigrants, punks, and yuppies alike. Stores include surplus shops, coffee houses, small restaurants (including vegetarian), clothing vendors, and record stores. Fish and fruit markets are also present in great numbers, and the area is experiencing a boom of South American food stalls of late.\n Koreatown has many Korean retail businesses and restaurants where Korean is as prominent as English in the signage. (There is also another Koreatown in North York.\n Gerrard India Bazaar (Little India) If you want to get a sense of Toronto's vibrant South Asian community, this is where you want to be; not only is Indian culture represented - visible Pakistani and Afghan communities are also alive along the street.\n The 501 Queen streetcar has been recognized in National Geographic magazine for being the longest streetcar route in North America (one of the longest in the world). The journey from one end to the other takes a couple of hours and passes through a wide range of ethnic and cultural neighbourhoods.\n\n Sports teams & arenas \n\nToronto has several major league and minor league sports teams:\n\n Toronto Argonauts - Canadian Football League, playing at BMO Field on the Exhibition Place grounds.\n Toronto Blue Jays – Major League Baseball, playing at the Rogers Centre (formerly known as SkyDome, and still generally called such by locals).\n Toronto Maple Leafs – National Hockey League, playing at the Scotiabank Arena (formerly known as Air Canada Centre).\n Toronto Raptors – National Basketball Association, playing at the Scotiabank Arena.\n Toronto Rock – National Lacrosse League, playing at the Scotiabank Arena.\n Toronto Football Club (also known as Toronto FC or TFC) – Major League Soccer, playing at BMO Field.\n Toronto Sceptres – Professional Women's Hockey League, playing at the Coca-Cola Coliseum (formerly the Ricoh Coliseum).\n Toronto Marlies – American Hockey League (Toronto Maple Leafs farm team), also playing at the Coca-Cola Coliseum.\n York United FC – Pro soccer team in the Canadian Premier League. They play home games at York Lions Stadium on the campus of York University in North York, but have long-term plans to build their own stadium in the York Region.\n Toronto FC II – MLS Next Pro (Toronto FC reserve team); as of 2024, TFC II shares York Lions Stadium with York United. A couple of home games are played at BMO Field as part of a doubleheader with the parent club.\n Toronto Wolfpack – Rugby league team playing in Super League, the top level of England's rugby league pyramid, which also includes 10 teams from England and one from France. The Wolfpack play at Lamport Stadium in the Liberty Village neighbourhood.\n In 2026, Coca-Cola Coliseum will also become home to an as-yet-unnamed WNBA team.\n\nThe Scotiabank Arena, 40 Bay St. It was called the Air Canada Centre (or \"the Hangar\") until 2018.\n\nThe Rogers Centre , 1 Blue Jays Way. Most often referred to by its original \"SkyDome\" name.\n\nThe Maple Leaf Gardens, 60 Carlton Street. Historic arena in Toronto, on the northwest corner of Carlton Street and Church Street in Toronto's Garden District; now converted into a Loblaws supermarket and an athletic centre for Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University), the Mattamy Athletic Centre at the Gardens.\n\nThe Sobey's Stadium (formerly Aviva Centre), 1 Shoreham Drive. A tennis complex that serves mainly as a training facility, but also includes a main stadium court that frequently hosts seasonal concerts. The most notable use of the complex is for the annual Canadian Open (sponsored as the National Bank Open formerly Rogers Cup), a high-profile event on both the men's ATP Tour and women's WTA Tour. The Aviva Centre hosts the ATP event in even-numbered years and the WTA event in odd-numbered years, alternating with Montreal in both cases."

    "Chicago": {
        "do": "Do\n\nBeaches\nChicago is not known as a beach destination, but Lake Michigan is the largest freshwater lake that is entirely within the United States, and Chicagoans flock to its sandy shores. Anyone can show up and swim — there are no admission fees, miles of beaches are within walking distance of the Red Line, and almost none of the lakefront is spoiled by \"private\" beaches. Despite the latitude, the water is quite warm in the summer and early fall (check with the NWS for temperatures). The Chicago shore has been called the second cleanest urban waterfront in the world, although bacteria levels in the water do force occasional — but rare — beach closures (which are clearly posted at the beach, and online. Lifeguards will be posted (usually in a rowboat) if the beach is officially open.\n\nOak Street Beach and North Avenue Beach (in the Near North and Lincoln Park) are the fashionable places to sun-tan and be seen, but Rogers Park has mile after mile of less pretentious sand and surf. Hyde Park's Promontory Point is beautiful, and offers skyline views from its submerged beach by the rocks. Swimming there is against city rules, but it appears this is not enforced. Hollywood Beach in Edgewater is the main gay beach.\n\nNavy Pier\nNavy Pier was built in 1914 and served as a naval base during both world wars. It is now Illinois' number one most visited tourist attraction (ahead of some boring exurban megamalls). The pier has carnival rides, including the popular ferris wheel, as well as theater, restaurants, arcades, bars, shops, and most importantly great views back towards the city.\n\nParks\nthumb|240px|The Osaka Garden on Jackson Park's Wooded Isle\nWhere there are beaches, there are lakefront parks. During the summer months, the parks are a destination for organized and impromptu volleyball and soccer games, chess matches, and plenty more, with tennis and basketball courts dotted along the way.\n\nIn the Loop, Grant Park hosts music festivals throughout the year, and Millennium Park is a fun destination for all ages, especially during the summer. Millennium Park is where the famous Cloud Gate and Crown Fountain are located.\n\nLincoln Park stretches for seven miles along the lakefront, with numerous bicycle paths, beaches, harbors and museums. Situated just east of the Lincoln Park neighborhood is the cheerful (and free) Lincoln Park Zoo which welcomes visitors every day of the week, with plentiful highlights like the Regenstein Center for African Apes. There are also terrific parks further away from the lake. In Hyde Park, Midway Park offers skating, and summer and winter gardens in the shadow of the academic giant, the University of Chicago, and Jackson Park has golf, more gardens and the legacy of the city's shining moment, the 1893 World's Colombian Exposition. In Bronzeville, Washington Park is one of the city's best places for community sports. And that's just a brief overview. Almost every neighborhood in Chicago has a beloved park.\n\nEvents & festivals\nupright=1.3|thumb|The Lollapalooza Music Festival\nIf you're absolutely determined and you plan carefully, you may be able to visit Chicago during a festival-less week. It's a challenge, though. Most neighborhoods, parishes, and service groups host their own annual festivals throughout the spring, summer, and fall. There are a few can't-miss citywide events, though. In the Loop, Grant Park hosts Taste of Chicago in July, and four major music festivals: Blues Fest and Gospel Fest in June, Lollapalooza in August, and Jazz Fest over Labor Day Weekend. All but Lollapalooza are free. The ultra hip Chicago-based music website Pitchfork Media also hosts their own annual three day festival of indie rock, rap, electronica and more in the summer at Union Park on the Near West Side.\n\nSports\nWith entries in every major professional sports league and several universities in the area, Chicago sports fans have a lot to keep them occupied. The Chicago Bears play football at Soldier Field in the Near South from warm September to frigid January. Since the baseball teams split the city in half, nothing seizes the Chicago sports consciousness like a playoff run from the Bears. Aspiring fans will be expected to be able to quote a minimum of two verses of the Super Bowl Shuffle from memory, tear up at the mention of Walter Payton, and provide arguments as to how Butkus, Singletary, and Urlacher represent stages in the evolution of the linebacker, with supporting evidence in the form of grunts, yells, and fists slammed on tables.\n\nThe Chicago Bulls play basketball at the United Center on the Near West Side. While quality of play and ticket prices may never again reach Jordan-era mania, they're still an exciting team to watch. The Chicago Blackhawks share quarters with the Bulls. As one of the \"Original Six\" teams in professional hockey, the Blackhawks have a long history in their sport, and the team is experiencing a renaissance after capturing the Stanley Cup in 2010 for the first time in 49 years. Home games for both teams tend to sell out, but tickets can usually be found if you check around. Both the Bulls and the Blackhawks play from the end of October to the beginning of April.\nthumb|Wrigley Field\nIt's baseball, though, in which the tribal fury of Chicago sports is best expressed. The Chicago Cubs play at Wrigley Field on the North Side, in Lakeview, and the Chicago White Sox play at Guaranteed Rate Field (Comiskey Park, underneath the corporate naming rights) on the South Side, in Bridgeport. Both franchises have more than a century's worth of history, and both teams play 81 home games from April to the beginning of October. Everything else is a matter of fiercely held opinion. The two three-game series when the teams play each other are the hottest sports tickets in Chicago during any given year. If someone offers you tickets to a game, pounce.\n\nThere are plenty of smaller leagues in the city as well, although some play their games in the suburbs. In soccer, Chicago Fire FC of Major League Soccer shares Soldier Field with the Bears, having returned there in 2020. The Chicago Red Stars of the National Women's Soccer League play at SeatGeek Stadium in the suburb of Bridgeview, near the Southwest Side of Chicago, which the Fire left behind. In basketball, the Chicago Sky (WNBA, women) play at Wintrust Arena at McCormick Place, and the Windy City Bulls play in another suburb, Hoffman Estates, as the top minor-league team of the NBA's Bulls. Allstate Arena in Rosemont, near O'Hare Airport, is home to the Chicago Wolves minor league hockey team. The Windy City Rollers skate flat-track roller derby in neighboring Cicero.\n\nWhile college athletics isn't one of Chicago's strong points, the city and the immediate area do host several NCAA Division I schools:\n \n \n \n \n \n\nAlso notable are the Chicago Maroons of the University of Chicago, a charter member of the Big Ten that deemphasized college athletics in the 1940s, left the Big Ten, and is now in NCAA Division III. If you find yourself in Hyde Park, ask someone how the Maroons football team is doing — it's a surefire conversation starter.\n\nChicago is also significant in the 21st-century history of professional wrestling. The All In independent show, run in 2018 at the Hoffman Estates arena that hosts the Windy City Bulls (which has been renamed the \"NOW Arena\"), was the springboard for the creation of All Elite Wrestling, which has become the biggest rival to WWE for supremacy in that field. In August 2021, AEW ran The First Dance, a show at United Center that marked the return of Chicago native CM Punk to pro wrestling after a seven-year absence. Two weeks later on Labor Day weekend, AEW's All Out pay-per-view held at NOW Arena saw Punk wrestle his first match since he left WWE in 2014. Punk would be fired from AEW in 2023 amid backstage conflicts, and that November returned to WWE, making his first appearance for that promotion since 2014 at Survivor Series: WarGames at Allstate Arena (though he didn't make his in-ring return at that time).\n\nTheater\nthumb|250px|right| The Gateway Theatre in Jefferson Park, seat of the Copernicus Foundation. The theater's Baroque spire is a replica of the Royal Castle in Warsaw.\nModern American comedy — the good parts, at least — was born when a group of young actors from Hyde Park formed The Compass Players, fusing intelligence and a commitment to character with an improvisational spark. One strand of their topical, hyper-literate comedy led, directly or indirectly, to Shelly Berman, Mike Nichols & Elaine May, Lenny Bruce, M*A*S*H and The Mary Tyler Moore Show; another strand, namely The Second City, led to Saturday Night Live and a pretty huge percentage of the funny movies and television of the last thirty years. Still in Chicago's Old Town (and few other places as well), still smart and still funny, Second City does two-act sketch revues followed by one act of improvisation. If you only see one show while you're in Chicago, Second City is a good choice.\n\nImprovisational comedy as a performance art form is a big part of the Chicago theater scene. At Lakeview and Uptown theaters like The Annoyance Theater, I.O., and The Playground, young actors take classes and perform shows that range from ragged to inspired throughout the week. Some are fueled by the dream of making the cast of SNL or Tina Fey's latest project, and some just enjoy doing good work on-stage, whether or not they're getting paid for it (and most aren't). There's no guarantee that you'll see something great on any given night, but improv tends to be cheaper than anything else in town, and it can definitely be worth the risk. Another popular theater experience is the comedy/drama hybrid Too Much Light Makes The Baby Go Blind, offering 30 plays in 60 minutes every weekend in Andersonville.\n\nSteppenwolf, in Lincoln Park, is Chicago's other landmark theater. Founded in 1976, they have a history of taking risks onstage, and they have the ensemble to back it up, with heavyweights like Joan Allen, John Malkovich, and Gary Sinise. Steppenwolf isn't cheap any more, but they mix good, young actors with their veteran ensemble and still choose interesting, emotionally-charged scripts. It's the best place in town to see modern, cutting-edge theater with a bit of \"I went to...\" name-drop value for the folks back home.\n\nMost of the prestige theaters, including the Broadway in Chicago outlets, are in the Loop or the Near North. Tickets are expensive and can be tough to get, but shows destined for Broadway like The Producers often make their debut here. For the cost-conscious, the League of Chicago Theatres operates Hot Tix, which offers short-notice half-price tickets to many Chicago shows.\n\nOne theater to see, regardless of the production, is The Auditorium in the Loop. It's a masterpiece of architecture and of performance space. Designed by Dankmar Adler and Louis Sullivan, who were on a commission from syndicate of local business magnates to bring some culture to the heathen city, it was the tallest building in Chicago and one of the tallest in the world at the time of its opening in 1889, and it's still an impressive sight, inside and out.\n\nBicycles\nChicago has a strong, passionate bicycle culture, and riding opportunities abound. Pedaling your way around the city is one of the best ways to get to know Chicago. And the terrain is mostly flat — a boon for easy-going cyclists! If you don't have a bike, that's no problem. Bobby's Bike Hike is probably best for longer-term rentals and bike tours, with a central bike rental location near Navy Pier, at 540 N. Lake Shore Drive, entrance on Ohio St near Inner Lake Shore Drive. Alternatively, the city's distinctively blue DIVVY bike sharing system, the largest system in North America in terms of geographical area, has kiosks throughout much of the city. 24 hour passes cost $9.95, but that doesn't mean you keep the bike for 24 hours — it means you can take an unlimited number of rides, up to 30 minutes each, over the course of those 24 hours, parking at the same or different kiosks along the way, with trips over 30 minutes paying additional fees. Hence, the system is geared toward short trips, not leisurely tourist rides along the lakefront, and while you can still ride recreationally, be prepared to watch the time. DIVVY launched in 2013 with 750 bikes at 75 stations and has since been expanded aggressively. By the end of 2016, the system will include more than 5700 bikes at 571 stations, ranging from the northern suburb of Evanston to the western suburb of Oak Park to 79th Street in South Shore, far in the South Side.\n\nThe scenic Lakefront Trail runs for 18 continuous miles along the city's beautiful shoreline, from Hollywood Beach in Edgewater to the magnificent South Shore Cultural Center. Even while riding at a moderate pace, traveling downtown along the lakefront can be faster than driving or taking the CTA! If you're starting from downtown, you'll be at the approximate midpoint of the trail. Head south if you want a speed workout with fewer crowds, or north to see more of the locals at play.\n\nFurther inland, many streets have bike lanes, and signs direct riders to major bike routes. The City of Chicago maintains helpful bicycle resources online, including major civic bike events and (slow) interactive maps of major streets with bike lanes. Of special note is the unofficially named Hipster Highway which is Milwaukee Avenue from Kinzie St in the West Loop to Logan Square, which is a popular bike route where bicyclists oftentimes outnumber cars! Also of note is Dearborn Street in the Loop which is a two way protected bicycle lane on a one way highway (cycle track for you Europeans) complete with special signals for bikes. If you are going against car traffic on Dearborn, you must be more cautious about pedestrians who aren't expecting bicycles heading opposite the way they are used to looking, though they're getting accustomed to the bikeway after its first few years.\n\nBicyclists have to follow the same \"rules of the road\" as automobiles (stop at red lights and stop signs, etc.) Bicycle riding is not allowed on sidewalks (except for children under age 12). This rule is strictly enforced in higher density neighborhoods, mostly areas near the lake, and is considered a criminal misdemeanor offense. You must walk your bike on the sidewalk.\n\nCTA buses are all equipped with front bike racks, which carry up to two bicycles, and 'L' trains permit two bicycles per car except during rush hour (roughly 7-9:30AM and 3:30-6:30PM weekdays, excluding major holidays on which the CTA is running on a Sunday schedule). With the buses, inspect the rack closely for wear or damage and be absolutely certain that the bike is secured before you go, lest it fall off in traffic (and be immediately flattened by the bus). The CTA will fight tooth and nail to avoid reimbursing you for the loss, and the driver might not stop to let you retrieve it.\n\nFor suburban connections, Metra and the South Shore Line (the latter a train into Indiana) have somewhat spottier records allowing bicycles onto their train. During rush hour on the weekdays (see the CTA, above, for approximate times) you're out of luck. All other times, bring a bungee cord or at least a string to secure the bike. South Shore Line, with which you can visit the Indiana Dunes, only allows bicycles on weekends, but it's testing a new service where you can conveniently store them on a specific section of the train.\n\nBikes may be rented from the North Avenue Beach House (Lincoln Park), Navy Pier, (Near North), the Millennium Park bike station (Loop), and from several bike shops in the city. Another option is to contact the terrific Working Bikes Cooperative, an all-volunteer group of bike lovers that collects and refurbishes bikes, and then sells a few in Chicago to support their larger project of shipping bikes to Africa and South America. You could buy a cheap bike and donate it back when you're done, or even spend a day or two working as a volunteer.\n\nFor an opportunity to connect with the local bike community and take a memorable trip through the city, don't miss the Critical Mass rides on the last Friday of every month, starting from Daley Plaza in the Loop (5:30PM). With numbers on their side, the hundreds or even thousands of bike riders wind up taking over entire streets along the way, with themed routes that are voted upon at the outset of the trip. Anyone is free to join or fall away wherever they like. Police are generally cooperative — take cues from more experienced riders.\n\nKayaks and SUPs\nKayaking in urban environments is a relatively new but rapidly developing industry. Chicago is considered one of world's premier self-paddle destinations. Paddling companies have access points on many of Chicago's amazing beaches as well as on the Chicago River. Companies like Urban Kayaks provide unique and insightful architecture tours as well as hourly kayak rentals right downtown just minutes walking distance from some of Chicago's biggest attractions such as Navy Pier and Millennium Park.\n\nAccess to Chicago's waterways requires boat registration with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources ($13) as well as small fees that independently managed access points may charge ($5–20). The Chicago River and the area of the lake near the Chicago Lock is a carefully guarded piece of national infrastructure and the U.S. Coast Guard and CPD Marine unit are known to regularly issue citations for violating the rules. High traffic volume and other safety concerns make it advisable to visit an experienced outfitter in the area to learn about safety and proper etiquette while navigating Chicago's waterways. Most outfitters will allow users to bring their own equipment as long as it is properly registered."

    "San Francisco": {
        "do": "Do\n\nHarbor tours\nthumb|300px|Approaching the Island of Alcatraz\n\nOne of the best ways to see San Francisco is from the waters of San Francisco Bay. There are many companies offering harbor tours of varying durations and prices but they all provide marvelous views of the bay, the bridges, the island of Alcatraz and the city.\n\nOnly specific island tours are allowed to land at Alcatraz, but the typical harbor tour will circle the island at a slow crawl, giving you plenty of opportunity to photograph the now-inactive prison from the water.\n\nAlso consider taking a ferry from San Francisco across the bay to Tiburon, Sausalito, or Alameda. Same views for a fraction of the price.\n\nMost tours leave from docks at Fisherman's Wharf near Pier 39. Tickets can be purchased at kiosks along the waterfront walk. Buy tickets a day or two in advance during the summer high season.\n\nBoats usually leave roughly hourly starting around 10AM and ending around 5PM. Multi-lingual guides are available on some tours. Prices range from $20–40, more for sunset, dinner, or whale watching tours.\n\nEven on a sunny day the bay can be chilly, so be sure to bring a sweater as well as sun screen.\nSome boats have snack bars on board, but bring your own water and treats to avoid paying high costs or going without. There are now limited refreshments and a souvenirs shop on Alcatraz.\n\nPerforming arts\nthumb|300px|Davies Symphony Hall\n San Francisco has a Half-Price Ticket Booth in the middle of Union Square, where tickets for most San Francisco theater performances can be purchased the day of the performance for half-price. Run by Theatre Bay Area, all service fees collected from the sale of tickets by TIX Bay Area goes right back into the theater community.\n Go to a concert, a play, a jazz or a folk-song performance. There are performances most days to choose from by the San Francisco Opera, the San Francisco Symphony, in Herbst Theater (where the United Nations charter was signed), in the Old First Church, and for musicals in the Orpheum or the Golden Gate Theaters, all located in or near the Civic Center. The museum of the Legion of Honor, located in Lincoln Park overlooking the Golden Gate (north end of 34th Ave), has organ concerts which can be heard in many of its galleries, Saturdays and Sundays at 4PM, as well as music performances in its Florence Gould Theater by the San Francisco Lyric Opera.  For the fall and spring jazz festivals look into the SFJAZZ calendar. San Francisco also has many jazz clubs, best found by browsing the web (an excellent site is SFStation.com). Contemporary bands are featured at The Fillmore Auditorium and less frequently at the large Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in the Civic Center.  The Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival is a large free annual concert weekend in Golden Gate Park. Many events are listed by the City Box Office.\n Ballet of the world class variety can be seen for only $10. San Francisco Ballet sells standing room tickets (with excellent views from the back of the orchestra) for their shows at the War Memorial Opera House in Civic Center during the afternoon of each performance as well as two hours before showtime.\n Plays are performed at the Geary (by the American Conservatory Theater), Curran, and the Marines Memorial theatres near Union Square, and at the small New Conservatory Theater near the Civic Center.\n Musicals from Broadway and Los Angeles are shown at the traditional Golden Gate and Orpheum theaters on Market, near the Civic Center.\n\nEvents\nThere is an incredible array of events going on in San Francisco — virtually every day there will be something of interest to anyone going on, and San Francisco's mild climate ensures that practically every weekend will bring another major festival or some sort of large event. Listed here are just some of the really big events going on:\n\nCultural events\n\n \n Big Book Sale: Fort Mason. A gigantic book sale where dozens of private libraries are donated and put on display. Cheap prices and hidden gems make this feel like an adult scavenger hunt.\n \n \n \n \n \n\nHolidays\n \n \n \n \n \n\nLGBT community events\nSan Francisco is famous for its exuberant and visible lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community, who always put together some very festive events:\n\n \n \n \n\nOutdoor and recreational events\n \n \n \n \n \n\nSports\nthumb|300px|Oracle Park\nThe Bay Area has several professional sports teams, although most of those teams play in nearby San Jose and Oakland rather than San Francisco itself. The National Football League's San Francisco 49ers moved from Candlestick Park (which has since been demolished) in San Francisco to Santa Clara in 2014.\n\nThe San Francisco Giants are the city's Major League Baseball team, playing their home games at the lovely Oracle Park (recently renamed from AT&T Park) in SoMa and commanding a large and devoted fan base. With the Niners' move to Santa Clara, the Giants were the only team in America's major sports leagues playing in the city itself for a few years, but they've now been joined by the NBA's Golden State Warriors, which moved from their longtime home in Oakland to the new Chase Center, located on the Mission Bay waterfront a few blocks south of Oracle Park, in 2019. The NBA's women's counterpart, the WNBA, will add the Golden State Valkyries for the 2025 season. The Valkyries are owned by the Warriors and will also play at Chase Center. (The WNBA season has minimal overlap with that of the NBA, mostly taking place in summer.) As far as college sports go in San Francisco, the only NCAA Division I program in the city itself is the San Francisco Dons, representing the University of San Francisco and playing various college sports including baseball, basketball, soccer and volleyball at their campus in Western Addition. The San Francisco State Gators, an NCAA Division II program, play various college sports including baseball, basketball and soccer at their campus near Lake Merced. However, if you're interested in college football, you'll have to leave the city to see it—neither of the city's NCAA programs has a football team. The Bay Area's three Division I football teams are in Berkeley (California), the Peninsula near Palo Alto (Stanford), and in Silicon Valley (San Jose State).\n\nLocal music\n\nSan Francisco is a hotbed for underground music; a highly diverse array of musical styles is represented (e.g., rock, pop, experimental, weird folk, and avant-jazz). Shows occur every night, with as many as fifteen small shows occurring each Thursday through Saturday night. Much of this activity is not always well covered in the mainstream media; useful community-driven resources for finding about local shows include the Transbay Calendar."

    "Chennai": {
        "do": " Do \n\nChennai has several well-known beaches. The Marina Beach in Central Chennai is the second-longest beach in the world after Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh. Chennai is home to Guindy National Park, the smallest national park in India.\n\n Others \nDuring summers it becomes too hot and humid to venture out during the day. So go out for a stroll during the night (7-9PM) on the Marina beach and Elliots Beach (Besant Nagar). It's a nice idea to pack dinner and have a picnic on the beach as most locals do. If you happen to drive a car you can also consider taking along a few foldable chairs. Beyond 10PM, no one is permitted to be on the beach. There are policemen on the beach to ensure people follow this rule, and on some occasions they tend to shoo people out by 9PM. However, if you are an early riser, you might consider visiting the beaches early morning around 6 to 8AM The sunrise is wonderful and there is a slight breeze as well. However, be warned that there are dogs lying all over the place and you have a high chance of getting hit by a cricket ball if you aren't looking.\nStroll along the over crowded Pondy Bazaar and Ranganathan Street and try your skills in bargaining for knick-knacks. Be warned that it is an intensely crowded place, where you have to elbow your way through.\nTake a bus or an auto to Mylapore Tank and take a walk around Mylapore especially in and around the Kapaleeshwarar Temple. The crowds, sounds, fragrances of temple incense and flowers and the tiny shops are to be definitely experienced though keep away on Fridays. It gets too hectic even for experienced Mylaporeans.\n\n Music and dance \nChennai is famous for its concerts and performances that take place in various auditoriums and temples throughout the year, which are announced in The Hindu and other local newspapers. During the Tamil month of Maargazhi (December - January) there is a series of classical Carnatic music concerts and classical dance performances in various parts of the city, but the best are organized in various Sabhas (loosely translates to \"concert house\"). You will see mostly older celebrities, although occasionally there will be some world-class young virtuosos. Free entry passes are usually given out for debutante performances (called Arangetram in Tamil) and for performances held on weekdays (before 4PM when the crowd starts filling up).\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nChennai is a major centre of Bharata Natyam with over 1,000 dance performances a year. More dance forms are now encouraged and taught like Kuchipudi (Traditional dance form from Andhra Pradesh), Mohini Attam, etc. Some other dances like Odissi Manipuri can be found, but are rarer.\n\n Cinema \nWhen in Chennai, do not miss a chance to watch a movie. There are several new Tamil movie releases every Friday or to coincide with holidays. Apart from Tamil, movies in other Indian languages like Hindi, Kannada, Telugu and Malayalam also get wide releases in Chennai. Many of the Hollywood franchise movies enjoy a huge fan following and are screened at some theaters (dubbed) in Tamil. Make sure to book your tickets in advance especially for the weekend, because most of the cinemas will be sold out. Chennai also provides best cinematic experience at lowest cost ₹120/- and lesser, which is very less compared to other metro cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Kolkata. Check out any local newspaper or websites to get to know the movies running in and around Chennai. Some of the cinema halls are\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n Sports \nChennai has been one of the prominent sporting location in India, with wide variety of sports played almost everywhere right from every street corners to big stadium matches.\n\nCricket is a festival per se in India. Every TV in the mall is tuned to cricket during the match season and the whole city tunes in to the sport by one means or another. Chennai is an international venue for cricket and is also a home ground for the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) cricket team. While in Chennai it might be interesting to catch a game and enjoy the electric spirit of Indian cricket. Close to Chepauk there are several sporting goods stores where you can buy good quality cricket equipment at low prices.\n\nBook fair\nIf you happen to be in Chennai in January, Chennai Book Fair is an event not to miss. Location and dates may vary annually.Plan to visit on a weekday as they attract lesser crowds and you can browse through the collections peacefully. If you pick a weekend or holiday, try to visit in the morning instead of the evening. Look through all the shops but it is usually better to skip the marquee stalls and visit the smaller ones which have books stacked all around. You will be rewarded with some great finds as these shops have lesser known but excellent titles from all around the world. Carry cash as many of the smaller shops do not accept credit/debit cards and cash also helps to bargain down the price of the books to some extent. On average, paperback novels in bargain shops cost ₹100 to ₹200. A budget of ₹3000 should be enough to purchase a good collection of books."

Around lunch time is a good time to see (and sample!).  There is a store at Queen Victoria Market, but if you visit the Royal Arcade location, you can also watch chocolate making next door at Koko Black.\n Kick back at one of Melbourne's fantastic cafes in the CBD (Degraves St, The Causeway, and other laneways are fantastic for this), South Yarra (Chapel Street) or Fitzroy (Brunswick Street, Smith Street).\n\nSights & museums\n Melbourne's museums are generally well-regarded and worth a visit if you have time to spare. The Melbourne Museum and National Gallery of Victoria often have interesting temporary exhibitions.\n Visit the State Library of Victoria, and its magnificent reading halls. The La Trobe Reading Room boasts a large domed study area with an art gallery featuring temporary exhibitions on its balconies.\n Melbourne is an excellent place to master your photography skills.

Their home ground is Cape Town Stadium, capacity 58,300. \n Cricket: \n Golf: there's over a dozen courses around the city. Two notable examples are Steenberg GC in Tokai to the south, and Clovelly in Fish Hoek further south. \n \n \n\n Deep sea fishing \n \n \n \n \n\n Shark cage diving \n \n\n Diving \n\n thumb | 300px | On the way to a dive off Cape Town\n thumb | 300px | The sharks at Two Oceans are fed every Sunday, so diving visitors don't serve as desserts \nCape Town is at the meeting spot of the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean. Because of the Benguela Current the Atlantic Ocean is relatively cold (about 8°C to 14°C). The Indian Ocean is warmer (12°C to 17°C), and here you can see more colourful fish. The official border between the two oceans is at Cape Agulhas, but currents and eddies take the warmer water further west and these waters can reach the eastern side of the Cape Peninsula in False Bay, so from a diving point of view, the Cape Peninsula may be considered the interface between the two marine biological regions, and there is a notable difference in character between the waters of the two coasts of the peninsula. This manifests itself in the different range of marine life found on the two coasts. These regions are the South Western Cape inshore bioregion to the west of Cape Point, and the Agulhas inshore bioregion to the east of Cape Point.\n\nPermits:\n\nThe waters around the Cape Peninsula have been declared a Marine Protected Area (MPA). Permits are required to Scuba dive in any Marine Protected Area. This is a politically controversial issue due to disputes on whether due process was followed and whether the government department exceeded its authority, but the consequence is that a tax is imposed on all Scuba divers who dive in an MPA. The permit (valid for 1 year) may be purchased for R75 (2009) at some branches of the Post Office, or a temporary permit valid for 1 month may be purchased at most dive shops.\n\nFailure to present this permit when requested by an official of MCM may lead to harassment and possible arrest.\n\nDive sites:\n\nDetailed information and suggestions on local conditions, service providers and more than 250 local dive sites is provided in the guide to Diving the Cape Peninsula and False Bay.\n\nIf the open ocean does not appeal to you, the Two Oceans Aquarium also offer diving opportunities in their 2.2 million-litre tank.\n \n\n Events \nThere are many organized events in Cape Town throughout the year. An official calendar of events is available from Cape Town Tourism.\n\n  If you are not involved in or interested in cycling, avoid Cape Town on this weekend, as it is almost impossible to go anywhere as so many roads are closed.\nthumb|300px|The Two Oceans Marathon route takes in the Chapmans Peak Drive.\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n Safari \nBig Five Cape Town safaris are becoming increasingly popular. There are many safari game reserves with in 2 hours drive from Cape Town which is a great option if you don’t want to venture too far from the city.\n\n Hiking \nThere are many hiking trails in and around the city, from short walks to multi day hikes.\n \n \n \n \n Chapman's Peak Noordhoek, 2–3 hours non-strenuous with breathtaking views of Hout Bay and Noordhoek and rich flora, especially proteas.\n \n Cape Town has a very good network of trails to suit every level of fitness. Many of these trace the contours of the mountain and wander through the protea bushes and fynbos, often with breathtaking views. Many require no permit, although most of Cape Town's reserves have entrance fees. Hiking in a group is strongly recommended. The outdoor store Cape Union Mart has a hiking club with organized group hikes most weekends. Pick up a programme at one of their stores.

To some extent townships continue to retain their apartheid-era racial make-up, for a variety of reasons. Townships have also grown to cover far larger areas of land than in the apartheid days. This is a result of urbanization, especially over the past 10–15 years. Touring a township may seem strange, even inappropriate, but it is a good way to learn about South Africa's history, and the poverty that many people continue to live in. People in the townships are friendly and the children love visitors. Some townships however can be dangerous (see the warning on the South Africa page) so don't go alone unless you know what you're doing. The townships tours are safe. If you want to bring sweets or gifts for the children, it is best not to give it directly to them, but to give it to the tour guide who will distribute them later.\n\nTours can be booked directly or through one of Cape Town's many booking agencies. Tours run once or twice per day. Be aware that if you're given the chance to try some township food, that a 'walkie-talkie' is often made from the feet and beaks of poultry. The very best way to see a township is by foot and to stay overnight at one of the many township B&Bs.\n\nThere are several tour companies which offer tours.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n Wildlife \nThere are a number of small nature reserves in and around Cape Town.\n\n Koeberg Nuclear Power Station and Nature Reserve, Melkbos, consists of 3000-hectare buffer zone around the power station has been converted to a nature reserve with Bontebok, Genet, Steenbok and many other antelope.\n Table Mountain National Park forms part of the Cape Floristic Region UNESCO World Heritage Site. The park covers a large area of the Cape and incorporates a number of park areas. Most of it is free access; the only places you need to pay are at the Cape of Good Hope, Silvermine and Boulders.\n\n Wine tasting and tours \nCape Town has some of the world's best wine producing vineyards and maybe the world's most scenically stunning on its doorstep. The wine regions of Stellenbosch, Franschhoek and Paarl are all with in an easy hours drive, these historic and lush regions offer stunning views and world class wine tastings. You can self-drive but this come with limitations, often the best farms are closed to the public and then there is the drinking and driving issue. The best value and safest way to see the winelands is to trust your day to a dedicated wine tour company.\n\nWith South African wines becoming more and more popular worldwide, the number of tourists who visit Cape Town to learn more about the local wines is growing. The impressive variety of vineyards in Cape Town and the surrounding Cape Winelands make the choice which one to visit and which wine to taste very difficult. It is always a good idea to rely on one of the established wine tour operators. Guests should insist on a specialised guide with a thorough knowledge of South African wines.\n\n \n\n Whale watching \n\nMostly you will see Southern right whales, but on occasion you might also spot humpback and killer whales. Bottlenose and dusky dolphins also frequent False Bay.\nThe Southern Right whales visit each year between June & November to mate and calve.\n\nFrom viewpoints next to the coastal road between Fish Hoek- Sunny Cove railway station through Glen Cairn to Simon's Town one can often spot whales less than 100 m from shore.\nAt Cape Point whales can often be seen passing below.\n\nA number of operators also offer Whale Watching Cruises.\n\n \n \n \n\n Cinema \n "

Head off into some of the side streets for a cheaper, more local, and authentic experience of Barcelona. Often called Las Ramblas, because it is a series of several different streets each called 'Rambla de ____', the sections also have distinct feels.

January 1 is a nightmare though to many locals, with all the smoke, trash and the worse, injured merrymakers coming around, as well as a lot of drunk locals and expats. New Year comes again in Binondo, and the streets become alive with the popping of firecrackers and the Dragon and Lion dances.\n\nThe second week of January is highlighted by the Feast of the Black Nazarene, drawing a huge crowd swarming the old city streets from Binondo to Quiapo. The festivities last about a week, beginning with moving the black wooden image of Jesus to the Quirino Grandstand, where the ritual of kissing and wiping towels on the image (pahalik) begins, followed by the procession of replica Nazarenes and the climactic Traslación.  Security becomes a major concern, and it can be a hassle for some opportunistic tourists who want to join the crowd in this sacred festivity, as all space is occupied. If the crowd on January 9 is not enough, there are the Santo Niño festivals in the worker-class districts of Tondo and Pandacan. Streets of the mentioned districts become venues for dance parades and the procession of an image of the child Jesus. All Saints' Day in Manila is a solemn celebration, with families visiting the graves of their loved ones in the city's main cemetery, the Manila North Cemetery, but it's not advisable to join the crowds of Manila folks to visit some graves of historical figures."

The only sanctioned nudist beach is in Ågesta (Söderort)\n\nIf the open water is too cold for your tastes, Stockholm has several outdoor and indoor swimming pools and spas. Besides the public baths, the more luxurious ones are Centralbadet (Norrmalm), Sturebadet (Östermalm), Eriksdalsbadet (Södermalm) and Yasuragi spa (Nacka).\n\nSpectator sports\nThe most popular spectator sports are football (soccer) and ice hockey. Also, bandy has a cult following. Tickets for all games can be bought online from Ticnet.\nSpeedway is another big spectator sport in Sweden, performed on a race track in Gubbängen (Söderort).\n\nThe Swedish National Men's football (soccer) team plays international games on Strawberry Arena (formerly Friends Arena) in Solna. The Swedish top football league, Allsvenskan, is weaker than most of its Western European sister leagues, but the fans are very faithful. The season runs from April until October. AIK plays on Strawberry Arena. Tele2 Arena (Söderort) hosts Djurgårdens IF and Hammarby. These three clubs are in constant rivalry, and the decision to share one stadium was not easy.\n\nThe Swedish top ice hockey league is the Svenska Hockeyligan (SHL; \"Swedish Hockey League\"), and the season goes from September to April. Stockholm has had no team in the SHL since the 2021–22 season; the city's two main clubs, AIK and Djurgårdens, play in the second level, HockeyAllsvenskan, as of 2023. Both clubs play home games at Hovet (Söderort).\n\nBandy is played from November to February. Dress warm, as the game is played outdoors in two 45-minute halves. Stockholm has only one team in the top men's bandy league: Hammarby. The final of the Swedish League takes place on Strawberry Arena (Solna) or Tele2 Arena (Södermalm).\n\nThese stadiums also host frequent concerts and stage shows; see Stockholm Live for calendar and tickets.\n\nDoing sport\nthumb|Vikingarännet, an annual ice-skating race from Uppsala to Stockholm.\n\nThere are many opportunities to do sport in Stockholm.\n\nStockholm has many short slopes for downhill snowsports: Hammarbybacken (Söderort), Ekebyhovsbacken (Ekerö), Ekholmsnäsbacken (Lidingö), Flottsbrobacken (Södertörn), etc. with lifts and equipment rental when weather allows. The height is modest, but most hills have a great view, well worth a hike any season. Tracks for cross-country skiing are available throughout Stockholm; the ground is usually, but not always, covered by snow in January–February.\n\nThere are many open fields in Stockholm. Gärdet (T Karlaplan or T Gärdet) is good for outdoor sport. There are also horse riding venues and many golf courses open for visitors in the inner region.\n\nIf you would rather compete in an event, one of the most visible sporting events is the Stockholm Marathon, held annually on a Saturday in late May or early June, when some 18,000 participants run two laps around the inner city. Another one is the Lidingöloppet, a 30 km cross-country race branded as the world's most attended, and a part of the Swedish Classic Circuit, on Lidingö in early September. For hardcore swimmers, Ötillö (literally island to island) is an all-day swim-run race where teams of two swim between and run across many islands in the Stockholm archipelago.\n\nArts\nthumb|Hötorget, with The Stockholm Concert Hall at Hötorget (Norrmalm), where the Nobel Prize ceremony takes place.\nStockholm's national stages, the Royal Dramatic Theatre and the Royal Opera stage classic and modern plays, operas and ballets. There are many other playhouses, such as the Stockholm City Theatre. The theatre season generally runs from late August until the beginning of June. In the summer the Parkteatern stages free-entrance plays and monologues in the parks of Stockholm. During September–May, a range of international and local musicals, as well as other shows, are provided at the many theatres.\n\nCinema films are not dubbed, but subtitled. Except the multiplexes (most of them THX certified), a few classic cinema theaters remain: Rigoletto, Grand Sveavägen, Saga,  and Skandia (Norrmalm) Park (Östermalm) and Victoria (Södermalm). While SF has a de facto monopoly for mainstream film, there are some independent cinemas.\n\nA couple of large cultural events are arranged every year. Culture Night Stockholm takes place annually in springtime, with free admission to several museums, special performances around the city, from 18:00 until midnight. In August the Stockholm Culture Festival takes place, in tandem with the Ung 08  youth festival in Kungsträdgården. During this time of the year, the Stockholm International Film Festival also hosts an  open-air cinema in the Tantolunden park during one week in August. The major Stockholm International Film Festival takes place in November, and draws large international crowds.\n\nStockholm has a growing scene for standup comedy in Swedish and English. The Big Ben Bar (Södermalm), Folkungagatan 97, has a free-entrance comedy club in English each Thursday at 20:00. Skrattstock is an annual comedy festival organized every summer.\n\nThe live music stage in Stockholm is something else. There are never any signs of anyone playing but a few posters in specific areas. Although a lot of the cities bars have live music, the most common place to find it is around Södermalm. There you will find places like Debaser, Hornhuset and Trädgården. Besides Södermalm both Norrmalm and Vasastan have a few interesting venues.\n\nOn Sunday evenings from September to May at Skeppsholmen there is live Swedish folk music at Folkmusikhuset. Go to listen or to dance Swedish folk dances. Free entrance.\n\nStockholm hosts many expos and conventions. The two largest facilities are Stockholm International Fairs (Söderort) and Kistamässan (Västerort).\n\nAmusement park and children's activities\nthumb|Gröna Lund seen from the water\n\nStockholm's main amusement park, Gröna Lund is on Djurgården (accessible by  Spårväg City, by the ferry to Djurgården or by bus 44). There are all sorts of rides including rollercoasters and during the summer the park hosts a large number of concerts by famous artists and groups, as well as popular dancing evenings. Opening times for the amusement park vary across the year. Check the website before visiting. The park generally is very crowded during weekends and concert days.\n\nOn Djurgården you can also find Junibacken, a theme park centered on children's books, especially Astrid Lindgren's stories. Skansen, Stockholm's zoo, is also on the island.\n\nGambling\nCasino Cosmopol on Kungsgatan 65 (Norrmalm) has 37 gaming tables and almost 400 slot machines. In addition, several major nightclubs have blackjack tables and slot machines.\n\nThere are regular horse races at Solvalla (Västerort) and Täby Galopp (Norrort).\n\nLGBT events\n\nAttitudes towards homosexuality and transgender expressions are generally tolerant. In the summer (generally late July/early August), there is an annual LGBT pride festival, Stockholm Pride, which is the largest in Scandinavia. The national LGBT organization, RFSL, can provide information on other events and venues.\n\nOutdoor life\nthumb|Tyresta National Park, a virgin forest 20 km south of central Stockholm.\nThere are many forests and lakes within commuting distance of Stockholm, with good chances to see wild animals such as moose, deer and boars. Much of outer Östermalm consists of forest and farmland within a walk from the metro.\n\nIn Södertörn, one can find Nackareservatet, Tyresta National Park and Bornsjön."

The most widely known and elegant balls are the Opera Ball in the State Opera or the ball of the Wiener Philharmoniker. Many professional guilds have their own ball, e.g. the Kaffeesiederball by the Vienna Coffee house owners. A different twist is the famous Life Ball, an AIDS/HIV benefit which features celebrities and other attendees wearing outrageous costumes. The ball calendar can be found on the pages of the Vienna City Council\n River and Canal tours — The canal tours are horrible. All you see are trees and industrial buildings. It's a waste of money and time.\nThere are also a lot of other open-air-film festivals in summer, e.g. at Karlsplatz, the Vienna Turf Krieau, the Prater, the Arena, the rooftop of City Library on Urban-Loritz-Platz and Schloss Neugebäude.\nIn the summer, there is also the ImPulsTanz Festival for contemporary dance & performance. They are also good if you are interested in dance workshops.\n Football: international soccer matches are played at Ernst Happel Stadium on the riverbank in the Inner East district. The city has two club teams playing in the Austrian Bundesliga, the country's top tier: SK Rapid Wien play at Allianz Stadium in the Outer West, and FK Austria Wien play at Generali (or Viola) Arena in the Outer South.  \n\nClassical music\nthumb|Musikverein Vienna\nVienna is considered by many to be the spiritual home of European classical music, with many great composers such as Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Schubert and Johann Strauss II spending a significant part of their careers in Vienna.\n\nFrom May to December you can attend concerts of the Vienna Hofburg Orchestra which take place in the Festival Hall and the Redoutensäle of Vienna's Hofburg Imperial Palace. The orchestra's program is composed of Viennese waltz and operetta melodies by Johann Strauss, Franz Lehár and Emmerich Kálmán along with opera arias and duets by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Each year on the evenings of December 31 and January 1 the Vienna Hofburg Orchestra performs traditional Viennese New Year's Eve and New Year's Concerts in the Hofburg's festival halls. These concerts however, along with those that are from similar ensembles, are quite expensive for what they offer, and are intended for the entertainment of tourists.\n\nFor a more serious program, other concerts at the Musikverein and the Staatsoper can be attended for as little as €3-4 (standing room). They feature some of the best musicians in the world, including of course, the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. With concerts starting at almost the price of a cup of coffee, Vienna boasts a frequent and outstanding roster that is financially accessible to all. Much of the musical scene in Vienna is absent during the summer months, with the exception of the ensembles that cater to tourists. The solution would be to travel to Salzburg, where the Vienna Philharmonic resides during the summer.\n\nFor those who wish to watch opera, the Vienna State Opera is the most famous opera house in the city.\n\n U-Bahn-Stars\nThe Vienna U-Bahn-Stars are free of charge music event, daily running in the subway stations Westbahnhof, Praterstern, Karlsplatz, Stephansplatz, Neubaugasse and Spittelau."

Prices vary between €6.50 and €17.50 depending on location, time and 2D/3D.\n\nCinemas concentrating on classic and art house films are few and far between in Helsinki today. The cinema Orion, Eerikinkatu 15, run by the Finnish National Audiovisual Archive, displays a wide variety of films, including classics. Tickets €6 for non-members and €4.50 with a membership card. Kino Engel, Sofiankatu 4 near Senaatintori, concentrates on European and world cinema. Tickets €9. In Summers, Kesäkino (Summer Cinema) is held in the inner court of Café Engel, Aleksanterinkatu 26. Tickets (€12) can be bought from the Kino Engel counter and for the same night also from the Kesäkino door 45 minutes before the screening.\n\nThere are also some (small) independent movie theatres in neighbouring Espoo, Vantaa and Kauniainen showing mainly the bigger blockbusters. Many of them have a matinée series of cheaper, more art house screenings supported by the local culture board.\n\nLuckily, several film festivals enrich the cinema culture in Helsinki region. The biggest is the Helsinki International Film Festival - Love and Anarchy held annually in September. Espoo has its own international film festival Espoo Ciné held every August in Tapiola and Leppävaara. In January, Helsinki Documentary Film Festival Docpoint takes over. Some of the smaller film festivals include (to name few) Lens Politica showing political films and art, and Night Visions focusing on horror, fantasy, science fiction, action and cult cinema. The Cinemania website collects at least some of the festivals together and also sells passes of 5 or 10 screenings that may be used in several festivals. However, check the site for the most up-to-date information as the ticket policy varies from festival to festival.\n\nConcerts\nthumb|The Tavastia Club at night\n\nHelsinki has an active cultural life and tickets are generally inexpensive.\n\nImportant performing groups include:\n \n \n\nAt sea\n\nHelsinki is on the Finnish Gulf, and several cruise liners arrange trips out to the archipelago ranging from short hops lasting only an hour or two to trips ranging a full day.\n\nEvents\nHelsinki's celebrations are among the most exciting in the country.\n\nJanuary\nthumb|right|An illuminated artwork at Lux Helsinki 2016, in the Ateneum art museum.\n\n \n\nApril\nthumbnail|Vappu\n\n \n\nMay\n \n \n \n\nJune\nthumb |Helsinki Samba Carnaval\n\n \n \n \n \n\nJuly\n\n \n\nAugust\n\n \n \n \n\nSeptember\n \n\nNovember\n \n \n \n\nDecember\nthumb|Senate Square on a snowy December morning\n\n \n "

In 2007, influential US entertainment Billboard magazine named Brisbane in the world's top 5 hotspots for live music. And in 2010 the city opened the Go-Between Bridge, named after the popular Brisbane indie rock band The Go-Betweens. There is no doubt that the locals love their music and a night out in Brisbane is not complete without experiencing some of the live music on offer. If you are looking for what's happening in Brisbane, most music and entertainment stores as well as some restaurants and cafés offer free entertainment magazines that list what's coming up within the next month or so. Brisbane and the surrounding South East Queensland region plays host to a myriad of music and arts festivals and are advertised in these magazines.\n\nThough you might find most musicians playing in the numerous bars and clubs around the CBD, West End and the Valley, there are some venues which are geared specifically toward hosting bands or artists that are on official tours. Some events allows under-18s in, but not all, so it's best to check beforehand.\n\nThe Valley Fiesta is an annual three-day event. It was launched by Brisbane Marketing to promote Fortitude Valley as a hub for arts and youth culture. It features free live music, market stalls, food and drink from many local restaurants and cafés, and other entertainment.\n\n Sports \n Football (multiple codes):  is host to Brisbane Broncos NRL and Queensland Reds Rugby Union teams in winter, and Brisbane Roar soccer club in summer; in 2023 it staged soccer matches in the Women's World Cup. Other events such as the NRL State of Origin are also a big draw-card.\n\n Cricket:  (aka \"The Gabba\") is south side of the city at Woolloongabba. It hosts all formats of cricket in summer, including \"Test matches\" - internationals. In winter it hosts Brisbane Lions AFL team.\n\n Golf:  +61 7 3252 9891. Herston Road, Herston. Public course right in the centre of the city. Par 65. $22 for 18 holes during the week.\n  +61 7 3403 2556/7, 18 holes for $26. Good food at the 10 Acre Cafe with fantastic views overlooking the course.\n\n Events \n\nThanks to Brisbane's year-round wonderful climate, it's the perfect city to host outdoor events. The city often plays host to cultural and historic celebrations, music festivals and family entertainment, particularly in the Summer holiday months of December, January and February.\n\nthumb|400px|Brisbane Festival Riverfire event fireworks on Story Bridge\n \n \n \n \n\nEach year, Brisbane also hosts several parades through the central city.

The cheapest are in the west, with adult tickets at WestCity in Henderson the lowest at $8.50, and a bit higher at $10 at LynnMall and Westgate. Hoyts Hibiscus Coast in the north on Whangaparaoa Peninsula is also cheap at $10.90. Elsewhere in Auckland prices are in the $18.50 to $19.50 range, except on Tuesdays when there is a $12.50 special (2017 prices).\n Visit the Waitakere Ranges in West Auckland, replete with impressive waterfalls and rugged but beautiful beaches. Around 45 min (peak hours) drive from central Auckland.\n Eden Park in Central Auckland is the national stadium, hosting rugby union and cricket. \n Golf: notable courses are Gulf Harbour, and Formosa at Beachlands. \n\nBeaches\nThere are many beaches, due to Auckland's straddling of two harbours. The most popular ones are in three areas:\n\nNorth Shore beaches (in North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south. They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most have shade provided by pohutukawa trees. Most are accessible by bus. Takapuna Beach is the most centrally located, with a lovely beach-front café at one end. Just north of Long Bay is a family nudist beach. St Leonard's Beach is gay male nudist. Others are conventional.\nTamaki Drive beaches are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland. These are sometimes-crowded family beaches with a good range of shops lining the shore. Swimming is safe. Mission Bay beach is Auckland's equivalent of Los Angeles' Santa Monica/Venice Beach and is extremely popular on a hot summer's day. To its east, Kohimarama and St Heliers beaches are usually less crowded. Ladies Bay to the east of St Heliers has historically been a nudist-friendly beach, but is frequented by regular beachgoers too, and is accessible by a 5 min walk down from the cliff-top road.\nthumb|Piha Beach\nWest coast beaches are on the Tasman Sea, and have large expanses of sand and rolling surf. They have unpredictable rips so you should swim only between the lifeguards' flags, which cover select areas of the most popular beaches. They are about a 40-min drive from the city centre (via West Auckland) and the roads are narrow and winding. You'll need your own transport. There's little shade available, and few shops. The sand on these beaches is dark in colour due to high iron content from its volcanic origins. There are several smaller beaches accessible only by foot. The major beaches from south to north are:\nWhatipu is the southernmost beach, and the most isolated. The last 7 km of the road there is unsealed, but in good condition. There's a track from the carpark to the beach conservatively signposted as 15-min walk. There are several volcanic outcrops surrounding the beach, and native vegetation including cabbage trees along the path. Manukau Harbour is just to the south of the beach, separated by Paratutae Island. Paratutae is joined to the beach except at high tide. There are caves signposted 20-min walk from the car park; the track is muddy during winter. The caves are less spectacular than they once were because they've partially filled up with sand. No dogs are permitted.\nKarekare is the next beach north of Whatipu. It's considerably more popular and there are lifeguards patrolling the beach during summer. Karekare Falls is a waterfall not far from the road.\nPiha is the best known and most popular beach. It has lifeguards during summer. The most notable feature is Lion Rock, which separates the northern and southern sides of the beach. There's a steep track partway up Lion Rock to get decent views. Kitekite Falls are a small and pleasant waterfall near the beach. Laird Thomson Track is a walkway from North Piha to the isolated Whites Beach, which usually has very few people on it.\nAnawhata has no road access to the beach, but there's a fairly steep track down from an unsealed road. This is the least used beach and you may be the only people there at any given time.\nTe Henga (Bethells Beach) is accessible by road, and has lifeguards in the summer. Erangi Point separates it from unpatrolled O'Neill Bay to the north, which can only be reached by foot.\nMuriwai is the second most popular of the west coast beaches. There's a colony of gannets (seabirds) which nest in huge numbers and are worth seeing year round. Muriwai has a café, a golf course, and lifeguards during summer."

    "Edinburgh": {
        "do": " Do \n\n Performing arts \nEdinburgh has an excellent concert and theatre life. The Usher Hall (Lothian Road, Old Town) has weekly orchestral concerts all year round with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. The Queen's Hall (South Clerk Street, South) is home to the Scottish Chamber Orchestra. The Lyceum (Lothian Road, Old Town) offers theatre performances. The Festival Theatre (Nicolson Street, Old Town) frequently hosts opera and ballet. Europe's largest theatre, the 3000-seat Edinburgh Playhouse (top of Leith Walk, New Town) hosts major West End shows. For a cheaper option, the excellent Bedlam Theatre (Old Town) regularly puts on good student theatre and is the home to Scotland's oldest improvised comedy troupe, The Improverts.\n\nExperience traditional Folk Music at one of the pubs in the Old Town or Leith which host regular sessions.\n\n Research your ancestors. The National Register lists all births, marriages and deaths in Scotland from 1841. It's in General Register House at the east end of Princes St opposite Waverley Station, but always start your search online. You'll need to pay for extended access to look back beyond 1841, for instance in parish records mostly held at West Register House in Charlotte Square. \n Central Reference Library on George IV Bridge in Old Town has old newspapers and other publications, many of them digitised. \n\n Outdoors \n Walk along the Water of Leith, a small river that meanders through Edinburgh, providing a peaceful haven from the busy city. Check out the Leith or Stockbridge and Canonmills sections of the route.\n Climbing Arthur's Seat, the extinct volcano, is a popular activity as well and rewards you with great views over the city (Old Town).\n If you have more time, then you should go hiking in the Pentland Hills for a (half) day trip (South).\n Steam railway excursions run from Edinburgh in summer: one operator is Tornado Railtours.\n\n Festival season \n thumb | 300px | The Hub houses the Festival admin \n\nEdinburgh in the summer becomes \"festival city\" when a huge number of major national and international arts festivals are hosted by the city. Most of these occur virtually simultaneously in August (or end of July). These cater for a wide variety of interests and include:\n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\nOne important thing to decide when planning a trip to Edinburgh is whether you wish to go at festival time, which runs from early August through to mid-September. Hotel rooms in and around the city are noticeably much more expensive then, and you will need to book well (at least six months!) in advance.\n\nChristmas and Hogmanay\nEdinburgh in the winter festive season is also huge with various concerts and other activities taking place starting a couple of weeks before Christmas and running up to a week into January. Princes Street Gardens play host to a Big Wheel, outdoor ice rink and various festive markets. As in most of the rest of Scotland, Hogmanay, the New Year celebrations, are the main focus of the festive season rather than Christmas. One night before on December 30, a torchlight procession takes place, finishing with a fireworks display. On the night itself whole sections of central Edinburgh are roped off and accessible only by ticket for the Hogmanay street party, which takes place across several stages and is easily the largest in Scotland. Hogmanay and Edinburgh fit together like hand and glove. On day one of the new year, you can watch or if you are brave enough take part in the Loony Dook in South Queensferry (people taking a dip in the ice-cold River Forth).\n\n Other events \n thumb | 300px  | Arthur's Seat \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The Royal Highland Show is a Highland Games & Gathering, Agricultural Show and much else, held at Ingliston (west), towards the airport) over a weekend in mid- to late June. \n \n \n \n \n\nCinema\nGo to the cinema. Edinburgh has a number of cinemas covering mainstream, foreign language and arthouse films. Most interesting are the Filmhouse and Cameo (Old Town) and the Dominion (South).\n\n Sport \n thumb | 300px | Hearts (in maroon) play at Tynecastle \n Rugby Union: the top matches are the internationals, played at Murrayfield Stadium west of the centre. Highlight of these are the 6 Nations games played Jan-March each year between Scotland, Wales, Ireland, France, Italy and England. They only play each other once each year, so in even-numbered years England and France visit Murrayfield, while in odd-numbered years Wales, Ireland and Italy are the visitors. City and stadium are packed when these games are in town, so be sure to book accommodation and match tickets well in advance.\n Week in week out during winter there are club rugby matches, where you'll often see international famous names in action. The city's professional club Edinburgh Rugby play in the United Rugby Championship (formerly Pro-14), the super-league of mostly Irish and Welsh clubs; their home ground is Murrayfield. Top tier of Scottish competition is the Premiership, and Edinburgh teams in this are Boroughmuir (Meggetland, Colinton), Currie (Malleny Park, Balerno), Heriot's (Goldenacre), Watsonians (Myreside Road, Merchiston) and (hanging on by their fingertips) Edinburgh Accies (Raeburn Place). Tickets will be no problem, just rock up at the stadium.\n Football: Edinburgh has four professional soccer teams. Hibernian (\"Hibs\") play at Easter Road Stadium in Leith in the Scottish Premiership, the game's top tier. Heart of Midlothian (\"Hearts\") play at Tynecastle Park near Murrayfield west of the centre, likewise in the Premiership. Edinburgh City play at Meadowbank, 2 miles  east of city centre, in Scottish League Two the fourth tier. The Spartans also playing in League Two at Ainslie Park in Pilton north side of the city. \n American Football: Edinburgh Wolves play at Meadowbank Stadium two miles east of the centre.\n Swim in the Royal Commonwealth Pool, used for the Commonwealth Games in 1970, 1986 and for the diving in the 2014 Glasgow games.\n Horse racing is at Musselburgh five miles east of the city.

        "do": "Do\n\nFalles\nthumb|upright|La Cremà (The Burning)\n\nOne of Spain’s most spectacular fire festivals, Falles (Spanish: Fallas) can be best characterised as a fire-fireworks-gunpowder street party extravaganza. The festival draws up to two million visitors annually, and is listed as a UNESCO ‘intangible cultural heritage’.\n\nIts origins date to the Middle Ages when the city’s carpenters burned piles of scraps in the streets and plazas near their workshops on 19 March, the eve of the day of San Josep (Spanish: San José, or St. Joseph). In the 18th century, it became customary to fashion these piles of junk with papier mache into human figures and sculptures, called ninots (Valencian for 'dolls'), which were assembled to form larger fallas. Eventually these fallas began to take on a satirical nature.\n\nAround 1870, Falles and Carnival were banned. In response to this, a popular movement arose to revive and preserve these traditions, resulting in a competition in 1885 for the best and most artistic falla. This prompted the development of casal fallers, neighbourhood associations which work year-round raising money and designing their fallas. Today there are about 400 casal fallers which each design an adult falla (falla mayor), and a smaller children’s falla (falla infantil); more than 400 of these fallas are burned on public streets every year. Many fallas reach 25-30 m in height – the best of these are in a special category Secció Especial (Spanish: Sección Especiál) and compete for the top prize, awarded annually by the City Council.\n\nA secondary feature of Falles are daily fireworks events, including gunpowder demonstrations (mascletàs) and large nightly fireworks displays (castillos del fuego). Along with these displays, people set off fireworks all day in the streets, beginning early in the morning and continuing throughout the day, making the city seem like a war zone and making it very difficult to catch any sleep.\n\nKey events and dates\nthumb|Falla de Secció Especial, surrounded by ninots\nthumb|Illuminated street in Ruzafa\nthumb|L'Ofrena (The Offering)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFalles museums\nIf you can't be in Valencia at the time of the festival, you can at least get an idea of what it's all about by visiting one or both the following museums.\n\n \n \n\nOther festivals\nthumb|Street procession during Semana Santa Marinera\nthumb|Festivitat Verge dels Desemparats\nthumb|La Moma i els Momos during Corpus Christi\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nthumb|Correfoc during the Fira de Juliol\nthumb|Batalla de Flors, Fira de Juliol\n \n \n \n\nthumb|Interior of the Palau de la Generalitat, open to the public during Nou d’Octubre\n \n\nPerforming arts\nthumb|Palau de la Música\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nPlanetarium and cinemas\nthumb|Palau de les Arts and L’Hemisfèric, in the City of Arts and Sciences\n \n \n \n \n\nBeaches\nthumb|Malvarrosa Beach\nThere are two city beaches, and several major beaches outside of Valencia.\n\n (Platja del Cabanyal / Playa de las Arenas), just north of the port, has a pleasant promenade with a number of traditional (and expensive) restaurants, bars, and ice cream shops. The more northern  begins where the promenade ends, and is the setting for volleyball tournaments, kite festivals, and windsurfing. In the summer both beaches have lifeguards and first aid stations, toilets, and snack vendors, and are very crowded especially in the afternoons. To get there, take the metro or tram to Eugenia Vines or Arenas station, or take the metro to Maritim Serreria and continue with the tram to Neptu (all on one ticket).\n\nTo the north of and immediately adjoining Malvarossa is  (Playa de la Patacona), which, although part of the municipality of Alboraya, is easily accessible from Valencia by public transport or foot. This beach is somewhat less crowded, and is also a good place to sample horchata, as Alboraya is a major producer of chufa, a key ingredient of the drink.\n\nThe beaches south of Valencia port are all part of Albufera Natural Park. They are generally well-maintained and far less crowded than the urban beaches, and easily reachable by public transport.\n\nSpectator sports\nthumb|Recortes are a nonviolent alternative to bullfighting\n \n \n \n Football: the city has two pro soccer teams: \n Valencia CF play in La Liga, Spain's top tier.

        "do": "Do\n\n The simplest, and perhaps best of all: get a map, circle the things you want to see, divide up your time and stroll around in the city. Spend time in charming cafés or restaurants, preferably not right at the main tourist sites, look at the market stands, walk on a bridge in the evening. The lively atmosphere of this jewel of a city both by day and by night cannot be experienced via guided tours, locked into a tourist bus/boat. Locals are usually happy to help, also to tell you what they think is best to see, what is better to stay away from or for a little chat just to keep up their English or German. Don't hesitate to ask questions.\n  \n Rent a bike. Rents are around Ft1,800 for half a day. Szentendre is a 2 hours ride from the centre and you get to see nice places, much of the way is at the Danube. If you prefer more organised ways, a guided bike tour gets you some exercise and introduces you to the local geography. For example, staff at Buda Bike [underground garage at the plaza in front of St Stephan's Basilica] are very friendly. They also rent bikes. Bike map on the Net \n Walk in the City park (Városliget) with your children. Walk around the lake and feed the ducks. See the statue of Anonymus at the Vajdahunyad Castle, a fairy-tale-like building. Széchenyi Spa, right next to the lake, is also enjoyable for children (see also the Baths section).\n In the winter, the same lake is transformed into the large ice-skating rink with an astonishing view during winter. It is a popular place for children and teenagers.\n The nearby Circus (Fövárosi Nagycirkusz - Great Circus of the Capital) offers performances with international artists.\n Next to it, the Budapest Zoo - one of the oldest in the world - offers more than 800 animals to be seen in a historic atmosphere.\n Experience an opera at Budapest's beautiful State Opera House or a performance of folklore or classical music at any of Budapest's many concert halls (details under Performing arts).\nBudapest River Cruise is an option to discover the city with Danube boat which takes 75 minutes and you can visit the most popular places with it.\n\n Events \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nPerforming arts and classical music\nApart from a renowned music scene, Hungary has a surprisingly rich theatre and art scene and, not surprisingly, Budapest is the epicentre of it. The season begins in mid-September and ends in June. Productions range from classic dramas and traditional operas to post-modern dance performances. The following venues can be particularly interesting for non-Hungarians. Tickets are bookable about one month beforehand at Interticket, the Hungarian theatres' official booking engine with a booking fee of 10% + Ft50.\n\nCinema\nIn spite of increasing funding difficulties, high quality cinema has remained alive in Budapest. For contemporary non-mainstream European and Hungarian titles turn to Budapest’s excellent art house film chain, Art mozi, most of their branches are provided with a café or pub and offer pleasant atmosphere to spend your evening. A few selected cinemas of this chain: Uránia National Cinema | Uránia Nemzeti Filmszínház where you can see the mainstream European artistic films with new Hungarian ones, the latter sporadically subtitled in English; Cinema Puskin (Puskin Mozi) an elegant, decorated multiplex offering quality, but generally easy-to-watch Hungarian and foreign films; Cinema Művész (Művész Mozi) is probably the most popular “Art Mozi” theatre in Budapest; Film Museum Örökmozgó (Örökmozgó Filmmúzeum) is your best choice if you’re in mood to see a film from the times when Leonardo DiCaprio was a child, mostly film in original language and are subtitled in Hungarian. Mainstream cinemas mainly show subtitled or dubbed Hollywood films and Hungarian romantic films. After the shopping centre revolution in the late 1990s, more than two thirds of the city’s cinema screens are operated by international chains and franchises. Two examples are: Corvin, one of the oldest, although completely modernised cinema in the city. The most centrally located cinema is the Palace Westend in Pest.\n\nThermal baths \n\nthumb|right|Gellért Baths\nBudapest has many thermal springs and its fame is still rising as a major European Spa location. The baths are among last vestige of Turkish culture in Budapest; some baths indeed date back to Turkish times. However, Hungarians have modified and moulded this tradition into something of their own during the last four centuries.\n\nThermal baths contain several thermal pools. They are usually complemented with multiple steam baths, massage services and other therapies including drinking cures. Unlike in some Scandinavian or German baths, Budapest baths mostly require you to wear your bathing suit.\nAmong foreigners, Russians seem to be most frequent visitors to Budapest's baths, followed by Italians and Americans.\n\nA tradition of night bath parties has evolved, often revolving around various branches of electronic music, see e.g. Cinetrip.\n\nTraditional public baths\nTraditional public baths used to have a slightly outdated but nowadays improving service and admission system and allow an authentic bathing experience with locals around you. At the cash desk, you sometimes have to select treatments in advance, often they are offered in distinct places of the building. Bathing time is not restricted, and, depending on the system, if you're finished earlier, part of your fee is repaid. Towels and sometimes bathrobe can be rented either at the entrance or inside. Changing clothes can be done either in a common area with lockers (gender segregated) or in cabins (kabinok) which may come in different size and is highly useful for families. While newer systems may be introduced, according to the proper ancient ritual you're handed a token with a number, which is also written on a blackboard inside the cabin door as a security code: you must remember cabin number. To access your cabin again, show your cabin and a token to attendant, and s/he'll open the door and check the number inside. In swimming pools, swimming caps are sometimes obligatory, and are often available for sale or rent.\n\nModern baths\nModern baths, such as Danubius Grand Thermal Hotel, are usually called spas, although their central component are thermal pool and multitude of steam baths/saunas, which is not always typical for spas in other parts of the world.\n\n Sports \n Football: the Hungarian national soccer team play at Puskás Aréna in Zugló district, completed in 2019. Several professional clubs play in the city - those in the top tier (Nemzeti Bajnokság or NB 1) are Ferencvárosi, Újpest and MTK Budapest. Honvéd since 2023 play in the second tier.\n The city has many health clubs, yoga & pilates clubs, riding schools, swimming pools and squash and tennis courts. On Margaret Island you will find joggers, and swimming in the Hajós Olympic Pool. Sports facilities are inexpensive in Budapest.\n\nCaving\n\n Caving in Budapest ranges from well-lit and renovated Szemlőhegyi cave, where you can go to parts of the cave in a wheelchair, to some of the more extreme tours in the Pál-völgyi–Mátyás-hegyi cave system, where you have to squeeze through several metres long passages with no room to spare. The Pál-völgyi–Mátyás-hegyi cave system is recommended for the adventurous (and non-claustrophobic) who wants \"proper caving\" instead of the more \"tourist friendly\" alternatives. The tours lasts between 2½–3 hours and much of the time is spent crawling or climbing, so some degree of fitness is needed. The guided tour includes a helmet, headlamp and overall so bring good shoes. Guides are professional. English guided tours are usually on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays late in the afternoon, but can be pre-booked by groups at other days as well. Bookings need to be for at least 4 people.\n\nPlease do not litter, write your name on the cave wall or damage the cave in any other way. Part of the experience is the feeling of being in unspoiled nature."

This period is characterized by mass building of cheap and brutalist residential \"sleeper\" districts (to accommodate large influx of immigrants from \"brotherly\" Soviet republics), as well as some remarkable Stalinist style architecture. Some places worth attention are:\n Latvian Academy of Sciences - in the city centre, it is an example of Stalinist \"Birthday cake\" architecture ((sometimes referred to as Socialist Classicism). The spire was originally decorated with a wreath and a five pointed star, which was removed after Latvia regained independence in 1991. The building is a cousin to similar Stalin-era skyscrapers and resembles many others built in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc at the time, most notably the main building of Moscow State University and Warsaw's Palace of Culture and Science. There is an observation dock on the top, price to visit is 6 EUR.\n Spilve Airport - a half-abandoned terminal building, which originally was completed in 1954, still remains as a notable example of Stalin's neoclassical architecture. There is a hammer and sickle on top of the building in all its glory - one of the few places where this symbol of USSR was not torn down and remains openly seen (it is illegal to display it in Latvia except in historical context). A large technical school existed here until the 1990s for major Soviet aircraft types, including Ilyushin Il-18, Ilyushin Il-62 and Tupolev Tu-134. On the other side (through the gate) is a cafe/bar with a nice view on airfield and for watching young pilots training (open in summertime), and it is also possible to see the original airport inner façade, with signs both in Latvian and Russian language. There are also tours available inside the building from time to time, but you'll need to ask around or contact Spilve airport directly. The tour is definitely worth it - interior is lavish, well kept, with intricate details. Interestingly, the airport building was a scene of many rave parties in the 90s. Socialist realism wall paintings are the best - each one of them has a story!\n Bolderaja district - a tour there is recommended for the adventurous types and ones who wish to really know what was living in Soviet Latvia possibly like. Most of the Soviet-built brutalist houses there, both from Stalin's and Khrushchev's era, still stand there with little or no renovation. Silikatu iela is a good place to start exploring. A former semi-military zone (due to its closeness to strategically important mouth of river Daugava), very different from modern Riga, eerily empty and atmospheric, it seems frozen in time. Some folks living there have not ventured outside it for tens of years. Check out the local bathhouses (\"pirts\" in Latvian) and authentic eatery / restaurant (Rozā pērle). There is also an interesting fortress nearby - Daugavgrivas cietoksnis - a closed military zone on weekdays, but available for visitors on weekend. The oldest, pre-Soviet part, still hosting a number of original fishermans' houses and local river \"beach\" frequented by locals, is located around Liela iela, Miglas iela and Kodola iela. You might also try to reach the nearby sea beach and have a swim while watching ships entering / departing Riga port. Bolderaja district area is not frequently visited by tourists, so try not to disturb locals and attract too much attention to yourself. Reachable by bus #3 from city center in about 30 minutes.\n Cafe \"Veronika - if you haven't had enough of Soviet \"aesthetics\", you might try to visit this eatery and have a Soviet - style meal. It is close to the center, but a bit difficult to find, this is another place which seems frozen in time. It is very cheap (a day offer can be had for 4 euros) and includes authentic service from the bygone times - a buffet-style choice, aluminum pots, self service for dishes, artificial marble columns and wall / ceiling paintings. As with Bolderaja district, keep in mind, this is not a tourist attraction but an actual eatery for working class, so keep your profile low and be polite with the staff / locals.

At night the square really comes to life as people navigate toward the exotic aromas and the entertaining sights. As the evening darkens, the hustle & bustle of activity rages on. The exotic music appears louder and more hypnotic.\n\nThe Medina is also the place to stay in a Riad, a Moroccan house with an internal courtyard. Most windows are inward facing towards the central atrium. This design of property suits Islamic tradition as there is no obvious wealth statement being made externally, no windows to peer through. Entering a Riad is like discovering an Aladdin's Cave in comparison to its non-descript exterior. They are great places to stay and offer an intimate and relaxing retreat.\n\nDirectly south of the Djemaa El-Fna is Rue Bab Agnaou. A five-min walk takes you straight to the famous Bab Agnaou entrance to the Kasbah district of the Medina. The Bab Agnaou entrance, through the ramparts, is by far the most impressive entrance of all medina rampart entrances.\n\nThe Kasbah, in comparison to the Derbs (streets) surrounding the Djemaa El-Fna, portrays a calmer, less abrasive atmosphere. It is home to the Royal Palace, also the former El - Badi Palace and the Saadian Tombs. This naturally creates better security, cleaner streets and a hint of being a special place within the medina. The Kasbah has its own little bazaars (Souikas), food stalls, restaurants, hotels and riads for travellers to enjoy.\n\n Hammams \n\nHammams are baths, often close to mosques to facilitate the performance of ablutions. In guidebooks and signs that call them \"Moroccan Turkish Baths\" the name \"Turkish\" is a misnomer, since Morocco (unlike Egypt or Syria) was never under Ottoman rule, but the historical role of the baths is authentic in Morocco.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nDesert trekking\n\nMarrakesh is not in the desert: you will spend several hours to get to the desert and day tours are therefore pretty stressful. If you have the time, spend at least one night in the desert or in a town close to your desert trekking destination. Beware of tours that don't include meals and water as they will drop you at 100 dirham restaurants far from any other option. Because of this and the kickback from shops you will visit, multi-day trips to Merzouga can cost as little as 600 dirham if you play agencies against each other.\n\nA good alternative to big desert trips is a day-trip to the Agafay desert. It is rockier (less sandy), but a common trip for the locals."

The hotel charges a small fee for non-guests.\nthumb|Kigamboni ferry\n Kigamboni also known as \"South Beach\", is across the channel from the Zanzibar ferry. You can get to the other side by ferry, not the same as for Zanzibar. Avoid taking pictures on the ferry or at the terminals, even of the skyline. The ferry is on a strict \"no photo\" rule, and passengers, even tourists have been forced by security forces to delete completey innocent panorama pictures. The ferry station is north of the Zanzibar ferry past the Kilimanjaro Kempinski Hotel near the main fish market. You walk onto the ferry which costs TSh 100. The crossing takes about 5 minutes. Once across, you can hire a taxi to take you to the beaches, most of which are accessed through the various hotels along the coast. Public beaches have all been sold to developers. Hotels, such as the Sunrise, will charge a TSh 5,000 entry fee. TSh 3,000 of which is returned to you in the form of food vouchers. Most hotels are about 5 km from the ferry and you should be able to get there for TSh 10,000-15,000 depending on your negotiating skills. There are also daladalas which ply the road to the beaches.\n\nIslands\nFor a great day trip, head out to Bongoyo Island. Bongoyo is a small, uninhabited island just off the coast. The boat to Bongoyo leaves from Mashua Waterfront Bar & Grill at Slipway, the upscale set of shops and markets on the Msasani Peninsula, just north of Dar es Salaam. A taxi from the city center should run you TSh 8,000. The first boat leaves at 09:30, with others at 11:30, 13:30 and 15:30, with a minimum of four people. The ferry cost Tsh 25,000 which includes a round trip plus the US$10 for the marine park fee. The return ferries are at 10:30, 12:30, 14:30 and the last one leaves around 16:30. There is a small restaurant on the island which serves a variety of foods and drinks (grilled prawns, fish and chips, egg and chips, beer). Another option is to buy food at the Shrijee's supermarket at Slipway. You can relax without having to worry about anyone stealing your things on Bongoyo. Take a hike around the island, snorkel in the clear waters to the southwest of the island (snorkeling gear may be rented on the island for TSh 6,000 per set per day) or just relax under a banda on the beach. Bandas are TSh 5,000 and a chair costs TSh 1,500 for the day. On the weekend, be sure to get on the first ferry if you want a banda, it gets very busy on Saturday and Sunday. When you come back, you can get ice cream or a meal at several of the Slipway restaurants and watch the sun set. You can also check out the Tinga Tinga paintings and other crafts at the market.  Walk to the south (toward the Doubletree Hotel) from the main part of Slipways, past the boatyard, to find many cheaper market stalls.\n\nthumb|280px|Kigamboni Beach\nMbudya Island is a smaller island just north of Bongoyo.  To visit, take a taxi or bajaji to the White Sands Hotel, near Kunduchi.  Two-way tickets can be purchased for TSh 10,000 per person, with a minimum of 4 people per boat, and there is an additional TSh 10,000 park fee when you get to the island.  The popular side of the island has beaches, bandas, a small bar, and a food pavilion (though the menu is very limited).  Beers go for about TSh 3,000.  There is also a somewhat nicer, though more expensive, bar on the northern end of the beach.  The rest of the island is mostly rough cliff face, which can make for some interesting hiking, though this is not advised if you don't have good shoes and dependable balance (the rocks are very sharp and scrambling is sometimes required).  The last boats back to White Sands leave between 16:30 and 17:00, though you can stay a bit longer if you are willing to take a smaller, overcrowded boat back to the Sea Breeze hotel, which is south of White Sands.\n\nTours\n Investours runs microfinance poverty tours, and you get to meet and talk to local entrepreneurs, see the Mwenge woodcarvers market in a behind-the-scenes experience, and even have a local Tanzanian lunch with some of the craftsmen. Your fee is then used as an interest-free microfinance loan given to the entrepreneur of your choice—out of the ones you met during the day. \n\nHiking\nHiking is possible in the Pugu Hills, some 12 km west of the airport. Villagers can assist as guide for a hike around the Pugu Hills or to the major cattle market of Dar es Salaam. Arrangements are through the Pugu Hills Nature Centre. For directions to Pugu Hills see web site.\n\nMovies\n\nThere are modern cinema halls like New World Cinema on Bagomoyo Rd. which hosts the annual European and Asian film festivals () and others listed below. You can buy DVDs on every corner but beware, many are defective Chinese counterfeits, poorly produced, and/or lack English translation.\n\n \n \n\nSports\n The Yacht Club on the Peninsula is a gorgeous place but requires membership fees. You can enter as someone's guest and swim (in safety) or boat. It, and other places around town, offer scuba-diving lessons. Gymkhana, on Gymkhana Road in town, has tennis courts and a nice golf course. Coco Beach is a public beach on the Peninsula which is very busy on weekends. Go any afternoon to see people relaxing, and eat local food. But don't walk on beach as muggings are too frequent. A few people surf here when waves swell a bit around the full moon. You can sometimes surf or kite surf at the beaches south of Dar, e.g. at Kasa Beach Hideaway (fantastic wide beach and surf-able waves in June). There's yoga three times a week (Mondays Golden Tulip Hotel, Thursday and Saturday at Dar Fitness Centre) and capoeira at 18:00 at the Little Theatre (beginners on Mondays, intermediate Wednesdays), and tae kwon do also at the Little Theatre, Wednesdays at 18:00. Kickboxing is also available.\n\nCulture \nRead weekly 'What's Happening in Dar' and 'Advertising Dar' to get all the news of what's going on, including weekend get-away specials. There are always events like dance and music performances, artist openings at painting and photography galleries, movie festivals etc. l'Alliance Française, Goethe Institute, Iranian and Russian cultural centres offer special events along with some occasionally sponsored by embassies."

All types of commodities including slaves used to be traded here, but today's market is mainly that of day-to-day goods, with many local handicrafts. Shopping and haggling at this colorful place is certainly an experience different from what you may be used to at home. Another good place for a walk is Tunis' largest park, Belvedere Park, which houses the Museum of Modern Art and the municipal zoo (closed Mondays), and overlooks Lake Tunis.\n\nThe Théâtre municipal de Tunis, mentioned in See above, is more than just a sight. If interested in classical culture you can go and see an opera, ballet, or other production there.\n\nHammams (traditional public steam baths) are common in the Muslim part of the Mediterranean and also in Tunis. Formerly the only place for all but the upper classes to clean themselves, hammams are still a part of the local culture — so bathing in one of these is a cultural experience in itself. They are often located near mosques as people used to wash themselves before prayer; ask a local where the nearest hammam is (the medina is the easiest place to find one). Remember that a hammam is either men or women only, or open to men in the morning and night and to ladies in the afternoon. Bring spare underwear, flip flops, soap and a towel."

Adventurous types might try the nightclub on the 3rd floor of the 3rd building in the central tower complex. Like any proper nightclub it only opens at 23:00. A non-alcoholic beer costs a small fortune, and, like in Italy and Paris, there is a charge to sit at a table.\n\n \nFitness\n\nThere are a few gyms scattered throughout Tripoli - there's in the centre off Omar Mukhtar Street that has fairly comprehensive free weights and aerobics classes.

At the Centre Pour la Formation et Promotion Musicales (CFPM) there is a Rap Zone every Wednesday afternoon at 16:30. Often there are people just jamming underneath the trees. They sell instruments, and they give drum, dance, and guitar lessons. At the restaurant Djoumkoume in Chateau Un there is live music almost every night, starting around 20:00 or 21:00. Sometimes there is a CFA 1,000-2,000 entrance fee. To get there, take a taxi to Pharmacie Chateau Un. Then, instead of turning right to go to Idrissa Nems, turn left and you’ll see it on the left.\n\nAlong the river\nthumb|250px|Banks of the Niamey river\nIf you have a friend with a vehicle or can rent one, you have several good options. Go to the Island Campement of Boubon, a half-hour drive up the Tillaberry Road. Cross the river for CFA 50/person and then on the island there’s a pleasant, reasonably-priced bar/restaurant. You can stay overnight in huts for CFA 5000. Another option is the Relais, a hotel campement on the river, open only on weekends. Just down from the Golf Club of Niamey on the Tillaberry road, they offer a reasonably-priced lunch, camel ride and pirogue trip; or just have a coke or beer and watch the river. The third option is Plage La Pillule, 10 km south of Niamey on the road to Say, just past the peage. Take water and lunch and rent out a shady spot in someone’s garden along the river. Canoe rides also available. Walk up the wash 2-3 km to the sand dunes. This “beach” is a favourite of well-off Niamey households.\n\nRiver trips do not have to be expensive if you do not need to see hippos. Rent out a whole non-motorized canoe for about 1000F an hour on either side of the river. Expect to have to bargain more around the Kennedy bridge and the hotels. To see the hippos, one way to do it is with Les Pirogues de l’Amitié, run by Sani Boureima, 93-80-69-51. From Grand Hotel, walk towards river. Turn into the first side street on the left and then go through the metal gate doors. They speak French, Zarma, and Hausa, and a tiny bit of English. The boat is a motorized, covered pirogue. You will have to bargain really hard. His starting prices are CFA 25,000-30,000 for 2 hours to see the hippos, but some have got it down to 15,000 with bargaining and patience. The boat fits 10-12 people. A day-long trip is CFA 50,000. You can also do a 2-day boat trip for CFA 80,000, and you provide your own meals and camping stuff.\n\n Other activities \n \n \n "
